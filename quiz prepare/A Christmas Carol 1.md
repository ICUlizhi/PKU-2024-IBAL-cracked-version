## 故事梗概

### 分段1
故事梗概：

1. **马利的去世**：
   - 马利已经去世，这一点毫无疑问。他的葬礼登记表上有牧师、书记、殡仪员和主要哀悼者的签名，斯克鲁奇也在上面签了名。
   Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it.

2. **斯克鲁奇的角色**：
   - 斯克鲁奇是马利的唯一执行人、管理人、受让人、遗嘱执行人和唯一的朋友及哀悼者。尽管马利的去世令人悲伤，但斯克鲁奇在葬礼当天仍然是一位出色的商人，并以一笔无可置疑的交易来纪念这一天。
   Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.

3. **公司的名字**：
   - 尽管马利已经去世多年，斯克鲁奇从未涂掉旧马利的名字。公司的名字仍然是“斯克鲁奇和马利”，有时新来的人会叫斯克鲁奇为斯克鲁奇，有时叫马利，但这对他来说都无所谓。
   Scrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names: it was all the same to him.

4. **斯克鲁奇的性格**：
   - 斯克鲁奇是一个吝啬、贪婪、孤僻的老人，他的冷酷性格使他的外表也显得冰冷，他的声音尖锐而精明。他总是带着自己的低温，即使在圣诞节也不愿让办公室温暖一点。
   Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.

5. **斯克鲁奇的孤立**：
   - 斯克鲁奇在街上没有人与他打招呼，没有乞丐求他施舍，没有孩子问他时间，没有人问他路。甚至连盲人的狗似乎都认识他，看到他来就会拉着主人躲进门口或小巷。
   Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, ‘My dear Scrooge, how are you? when will you come to see me?’ No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blindmen’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, ‘No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!’

6. **圣诞节前夕**：
   - 在一年中所有的好日子里，圣诞节前夕，老斯克鲁奇坐在他的会计室里忙碌着。天气寒冷、阴沉、刺骨，雾气弥漫，他可以听到外面院子里的人们喘着气走来走去，拍打着胸口，跺着脚在石板路上取暖。
   Once upon a time — of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve — old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement-stones to warm them.

   The fog and frost made the streets blurry, with red smears on the windows of neighbouring offices, like ruddy stains in the palpable brown air.

2. 斯克鲁奇的办公室门敞开着，以便他可以监视他的职员，职员在一个阴暗的小房间里抄写信件。斯克鲁奇的火炉很小，但职员的火炉更小，看起来像只有一块煤。
   Scrooge's office door was open so he could keep an eye on his clerk, who was copying letters in a dismal little cell, with a fire so small it looked like one coal.

   Scrooge's nephew suddenly appeared, cheerfully exclaiming, "A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" to which Scrooge responded, "Bah! Humbug!"

4. 侄子反驳斯克鲁奇对圣诞节的看法，认为圣诞节是一个善良、宽容、慈善和愉快的时刻，是人们在一年中唯一一次自愿打开封闭心扉的时刻。
   The nephew refuted Scrooge's view on Christmas, believing it to be a kind, forgiving, charitable, and pleasant time, the only time when people freely open their closed hearts.

5. 职员不自觉地鼓掌，意识到不妥后立即熄灭了火炉中最后的微弱火花。
   The clerk involuntarily applauded, then immediately poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark.

6. 斯克鲁奇威胁职员，如果再发出声音，就会失去工作。他转向侄子，称赞他是一个有力的演讲者，并好奇他为何不从政。
   Scrooge threatened the clerk, saying he would lose his job if he made another sound. Turning to his nephew, he praised him as a powerful speaker and wondered why he didn't go into politics.
