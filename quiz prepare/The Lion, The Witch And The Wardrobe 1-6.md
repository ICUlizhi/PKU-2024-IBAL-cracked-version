### 分段3
故事梗概：
露西进入了一个几乎空无一物的房间，房间里只有一个大衣柜，衣柜门上镶有镜子。除了窗台上的一只死苍蝇，房间里别无他物。彼得和其他人离开了房间，但露西留了下来，她认为尝试打开衣柜门是值得的，尽管她几乎确定门会被锁上。令她惊讶的是，衣柜门很容易就打开了，还掉出了两个樟脑丸。

露西看到衣柜里挂着几件大衣，主要是毛皮大衣。她最喜欢毛皮的气味和触感。她立刻走进衣柜，钻进大衣之间，用脸蹭着它们，当然，她没有关门，因为她知道把自己关在衣柜里是非常愚蠢的。很快，她向衣柜深处走去，发现第一排大衣后面还有第二排大衣。那里几乎完全黑暗，她伸出手臂以防撞到衣柜的后壁。她又向前走了几步，但并没有感觉到木头。

露西心想：“这衣柜一定非常大！”她继续深入，推开柔软的大衣以便腾出空间。这时，她注意到脚下有东西在嘎吱作响。她以为是更多的樟脑丸，便弯腰去摸，却发现脚下是柔软、粉末状且异常寒冷的东西。“这很奇怪，”她说，又向前走了几步。

紧接着，露西发现触碰到她脸和手的不再是柔软的毛皮，而是硬而粗糙甚至带刺的东西。她惊呼：“这简直就像是树枝！”这时，她看到前方有光亮，不是衣柜应有的几英寸远的地方。

### 分段4
故事梗概：

露西发现自己站在一个冬夜的森林中，脚下是雪，雪花在空中飘落。她回头一看，还能看到衣橱的门和外面的房间，那里仍是白天。她感到既害怕又好奇，决定向前走去。

Lucy found herself standing in a winter night wood with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air. She looked back and could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and the empty room outside, which was still daylight. She felt both frightened and curious, and decided to move forward.

她走了大约十分钟，到达了一个灯柱旁。她站在那里，好奇为什么森林中会有灯柱，同时思考下一步该做什么。这时，她听到了脚步声，随后一个奇怪的人从树林中走出来，站在灯柱的光下。

She walked for about ten minutes and reached a lamp-post. Standing there, wondering why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and what to do next, she heard the sound of footsteps and soon saw a strange person stepping out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.

这个人比露西稍高一点，头顶撑着一把白色的伞。他的上半身像人，但下半身像山羊，蹄子代替了脚。他有一条尾巴，但露西一开始没注意到，因为尾巴被他巧妙地卷在撑伞的手臂上，以免拖在雪地上。他脖子上围着红色的羊毛围巾，皮肤也略带红色。他的脸奇特但讨人喜欢，有短尖的胡子和卷曲的头发，头发中露出两只角，分别在额头两侧。

This person was a little taller than Lucy, holding an umbrella covered with snow. His upper body was like a man's, but his legs were shaped like a goat's, with glossy black hair, and he had goat's hooves instead of feet. He had a tail, but Lucy didn't notice it at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella to avoid trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen muffler around his neck and his skin was somewhat reddish. He had a strange but pleasant face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair, from which two horns stuck out, one on each side of his forehead.

他的一个手拿着伞，另一个手臂抱着几个棕色纸包裹，看起来就像刚完成圣诞购物。

One of his hands held the umbrella, while the other arm carried several brown-paper parcels, making it look as if he had just finished his Christmas shopping.

   - 埃德蒙在寻找露西时，闻到了樟脑丸的气味，感到黑暗和寂静，没有发现露西的踪迹。
   - He smelled the mothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy.

2. **埃德蒙的猜测**：
   - 埃德蒙以为露西以为他是苏珊来抓她，所以躲在衣柜后面不出声。
   - “She thinks I’m Susan come to catch her,” said Edmund to himself, “and so she’s keeping very quiet in at the back.”

3. **埃德蒙的行动**：
   - 埃德蒙跳进衣柜并关上门，开始在黑暗中摸索寻找露西。
   - He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do.

4. **埃德蒙的困惑**：
   - 埃德蒙找不到露西，也找不到衣柜的门，感到不安并开始四处摸索，甚至大声呼喊露西的名字。
   - He didn’t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction; he even shouted out, “Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know you’re here.”

5. **埃德蒙的发现**：
   - 埃德蒙注意到自己的声音有一种奇怪的回声，并且感到意外的寒冷，随后他看到了一束光。
   - There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound—not the sound you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of open-air sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw a light.

6. **埃德蒙的误解**：
   - 埃德蒙以为那束光是衣柜门的开启，但实际上他走进了一个被厚重的冷杉树包围的空地，脚下是干硬的雪，树枝上也有积雪。
   - “Thank goodness,” said Edmund, “the door must have swung open of its own accord.” He forgot all about Lucy and went toward the light, which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.

7. **埃德蒙的新环境**：
   - 埃德蒙发现自己身处一个冬日的森林中，天空是冬日早晨的淡蓝色，太阳刚刚升起，非常红且清晰。
   - There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees. Overhead there was a pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning. Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear.

8. **埃德蒙的孤独**：
   - 森林中没有任何生物，埃德蒙感到孤独和寒冷。
   - Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country. There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every direction. He shivered.

9. **埃德蒙的回忆与呼喊**：
   - 埃德蒙回忆起自己对露西的不友好态度，意识到露西所说的“想象中的国家”其实是真实存在的。
   - He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her “imaginary country” which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all.

10. **埃德蒙的再次呼喊**：
    - 埃德蒙认为露西就在附近，于是大声呼喊露西的名字，但没有得到回应。
    - He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted, “Lucy! Lucy! I’m here too—Edmund.” There was no answer.

这一段通过埃德蒙的视角，描绘了他从衣柜进入纳尼亚的奇妙经历，以及他对露西的态度转变和对新环境的探索。

露西感到非常失望和伤心，她看了埃德蒙一眼后冲出了房间。埃德蒙以为自己的行为很成功，继续说露西的坏话，但彼得愤怒地打断了他，指责埃德蒙自从露西提到衣柜的事情以来就一直对她不好，现在又玩弄她的感情，可能是出于恶意。

埃德蒙试图辩解说这一切都是胡说八道，但彼得指出，无论露西是精神错乱还是变成了一个说谎者，埃德蒙的嘲笑和鼓励交替进行只会对她造成伤害。埃德蒙无言以对，无法为自己的行为找到合理的解释。

   “Do stop it,” said Susan; “it won’t make things any better having a row between you two. Let’s go and find Lucy.”

She stuck to her story and said: “I don’t care what you think, and I don’t care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I’ve met a Faun in there and—I wish I’d stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts.”

6. 教授认真听取了他们的叙述，没有打断，听完后沉默了一会儿，然后提出了一个出乎意料的问题。
   So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said “Come in,” and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the whole story. After that he said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected: “How do you know,” he asked, “that your sister’s story is not true?”

7. 苏珊试图解释爱德蒙的说法，但教授认为这一点值得仔细考虑。
   “Oh, but—” began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man’s face that he was perfectly serious.

### 分段23
故事梗概：

在这一段中，教授与彼得和苏珊讨论了露西声称进入了一个名为“纳尼亚”的神奇世界的事情。彼得和苏珊最初对露西的故事持怀疑态度，认为这要么是谎言，要么是露西精神有问题。

1. 教授询问彼得和苏珊对露西的看法，彼得表示一直以来他认为露西是最可靠的，但这次的故事难以置信。
   - "That’s just the funny thing about it, sir," said Peter. "Up till now, I’d have said Lucy every time."
   “这就是这件事的有趣之处，先生，”彼得说，“到目前为止，我每次都会说露西是最可靠的。”

2. 苏珊同意彼得的看法，但她认为露西关于森林和半人马的故事不可能是真的。
   - "Well," said Susan, "in general, I’d say the same as Peter, but this couldn’t be true—all this about the wood and the Faun."
   “嗯，”苏珊说，“一般来说，我会和彼得说的一样，但这个关于森林和半人马的故事不可能是真的。”

3. 教授指出，指控一个一直诚实的人说谎是非常严重的事情。
   - "A very serious thing indeed."
   “这确实是非常严重的事情。”

4. 苏珊担心露西可能不仅仅是说谎，而是真的有问题，比如精神错乱。
   - "Madness, you mean?" said the Professor quite coolly. "Oh, you can make your minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad."
   “你是说精神错乱吗？”教授非常冷静地说，“哦，你们可以放心，只要看看她，和她谈谈，就能看出她没有疯。”

5. 教授提出了三种可能性：露西在说谎、露西疯了、露西说的是真话。他排除了前两种可能性，因此暂时认为露西说的是真话。
   - "There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth."
   “只有三种可能性。要么你妹妹在说谎，要么她疯了，要么她说的是真话。”

6. 彼得质疑如果纳尼亚是真的，为什么其他人每次进入衣橱都没有发现它。
   - "But how could it be true, sir?" said Peter.
   “但这是怎么可能的呢，先生？”彼得说。

7. 教授反问彼得，认为事物的真实性并不意味着它们总是可见的。
   - "What has that to do with it?" said the Professor.
   “这和它有什么关系？”教授说。

这一段的重点在于教授的逻辑推理和对露西故事真实性的认可，以及他对彼得和苏珊提出的质疑的回应。教授的冷静和理性为故事增添了深度，同时也为后续的情节发展奠定了基础。

   “But there was no time,” said Susan. “Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was such a place.”

2. 教授认为露西的故事很可能是真的，特别是如果房子里真的有一扇门通往另一个世界的话。
   “That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,” said the Professor. “If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world...”

3. 教授提到，如果另一个世界有自己的时间，那么无论露西在那里待多久，都不会占用我们的时间。
   “I should not be at all surprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its own; so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time.”

4. 彼得询问教授是否真的相信世界上有其他世界，就像露西所说的那样。
   “But do you really mean, sir,” said Peter, “that there could be other worlds—all over the place, just round the corner—like that?”

5. 教授认为这种可能性很大，并质疑学校教育的内容。
   “Nothing is more probable,” said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, “I wonder what they do teach them at these schools.”

6. 苏珊感到对话偏离了重点，询问教授他们应该怎么做。
   “But what are we to do?” said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point.

7. 教授建议他们最好都专注于自己的事情，结束了这次对话。
   “My dear young lady,” said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them, “there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.”
   “What’s that?” said Susan.
   “We might all try minding our own business,” said he.

8. 露西的情况有所改善，彼得确保埃德蒙不再嘲笑她，大家也不再谈论衣柜的事情。
   After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all.

9. 尽管暂时看起来所有的冒险都结束了，但这并不是最终的结果。
   And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be.

10. 教授的房子变得有些神秘和令人不安。
    This house of the Professor’s—which e

   - Peter whistled. "So you really were here," he said, "that time Lu said she’d met you in here—and you made out she was telling lies."
   - "Well, of all the poisonous little beasts—" said Peter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more.

7. 苏珊试图改变话题，询问他们要去哪里，彼得提议让露西带领他们，露西建议去见图姆纳斯先生。
