2. 露西最初享受着美丽的雪景，但随着他们不断行走，她开始感到疲惫，背上的袋子也越来越重。
   It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first.

   Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more.

   Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him.

6. 彼得在黑暗中询问这是哪里，贝弗尔先生解释说这是一个旧时的藏身之地，他们需要在这里休息几个小时。
   "Wherever is this?" said Peter’s voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness.
   "It’s an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times," said Mr. Beaver, "and a great secret. It’s not much of a place but we must get a few hours’ sleep."

7. 贝弗尔太太抱怨说如果大家不那么匆忙，她会带上一些枕头。

   Then Mrs. Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something—it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat, but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you’d swallowed it—and everyone went straight to sleep.

10. 露西醒来时感到有些冷和僵硬，她渴望一个热水澡。随后她感觉到贝弗尔先生的胡须在她的脸上，看到了洞口透进来的冷光。
    It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hours later) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath.

11. 所有人都突然完全清醒，坐起来，张大嘴巴和眼睛，听着他们一直在思考的声音。
    But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very sound they’d all been thinking.

### 分段8
在这一段中，故事发生在纳尼亚的森林里，随着春天的到来，雪开始融化，绿色的草地逐渐显露出来。爱德蒙被女巫和侏儒带着，被迫在泥泞中行走，追赶其他逃跑的同伴。以下是详细的故事梗概：

1. 春天的迹象：
   - 雪开始融化，绿色的草地逐渐显露出来。
   - 绿色的草地给爱德蒙带来了极大的安慰，因为他在无尽的白色世界中已经看了太久。
     "Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white."

2. 女巫的决定：
   - 由于雪融化，雪橇无法继续前进，女巫决定步行追赶。
   - 女巫命令侏儒将爱德蒙的手绑在背后，并带上鞭子，同时解开驯鹿的挽具，让它们自己回家。
     "Then we must walk," said the Witch. "We shall never overtake them walking," growled the dwarf. "Not with the start they’ve got."

3. 爱德蒙的困境：
   - 爱德蒙被迫在泥泞和湿草中快速行走，每次滑倒都会受到侏儒的咒骂和鞭打。
   - 女巫不断催促他们加快速度。
     "Faster! Faster!" said the Witch.

4. 春天的进一步迹象：
   - 绿色的草地越来越多，雪越来越少，树木开始脱去雪衣，露出深绿色的针叶或黑色的枝条。
   - 雾气从白色变为金色，最终完全消散，阳光洒在森林的地面上，树梢之间可以看到蓝天。
     "Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of snow grew smaller."

5. 更多的春天奇迹：
   - 爱德蒙在一片白桦树的空地上看到地上覆盖着小黄花——侧金盏花。
   - 他们穿过一条小溪，发现溪边生长着雪花莲。
     "Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers—celandines."

6. 鸟儿的歌声：
   - 爱德蒙注意到一棵老树下生长着十几朵番红花——金色、紫色和白色。
   - 鸟儿的歌声开始在森林中回响，整个森林充满了鸟儿的音乐，爱德蒙看到鸟儿在枝头栖息、飞翔、追逐和梳理羽毛。
     "Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree."

7. 女巫的催促：
   - 女巫不断催促他们加快速度，天空变得更加蔚蓝，白云不时匆匆掠过。
   - 在宽阔的林间空地上，有报春花盛开。
     "Faster! Faster!" said the Witch. "There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time."

这一段通过描绘春天的到来和爱德蒙的困境，展现了纳尼亚森林中的生机与变化，同时也突出了女巫的冷酷和无情。
<br/>
### 分段9
故事梗概：

1. **春天的到来**：
   - 旅行者在森林中行走，树木开始苏醒，各种树木展现出不同的绿色和金色，光线也变得绿意盎然。一只蜜蜂飞过他们的路径。
   “This is no thaw,” said the dwarf, suddenly stopping. “This is Spring. What are we to do? Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan’s doing.”
   “这不是解冻，”矮人突然停下来，“这是春天。我们该怎么办？我告诉你，你的冬天已经被摧毁了！这是阿斯兰的作为。”

2. **白女巫的威胁**：
   - 白女巫对阿斯兰的名字表示出极大的敌意，威胁说如果再提到这个名字，就会立刻杀死对方。
   “If either of you mentions that name again,” said the Witch, “he shall instantly be killed.”
   “如果你们中再有人提到那个名字，”女巫说，“他就会立刻被杀死。”

3. **孩子们和河狸的旅程**：
   - 与此同时，河狸和孩子们在森林中行走，享受着春天的美景，他们已经忘记了冬天的寒冷，完全沉浸在春天的氛围中。
   While the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beavers and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream.
   当矮人和白女巫在说这些话时，几英里外，河狸和孩子们正一小时又一小时地走进一个似乎是美梦的旅程。

4. **春天的魔法**：
   - 他们惊讶地看到整个森林在几小时内从一月变成了五月，他们知道这是白女巫的魔法被打破的结果。
   They hadn’t even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch’s schemes.
   他们甚至不确定（像女巫那样）当阿斯兰来到纳尼亚时会发生什么。但他们都知道是女巫的咒语导致了无尽的冬天；因此，当这个魔法春天开始时，他们都知道女巫的计划出了问题，而且出了大问题。

5. **旅途的疲惫与期待**：
   - 孩子们和河狸虽然疲惫，但并不感到痛苦，他们慢慢地走着，享受着春天的气息，期待着即将到来的目的地。
   They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I’d call bitterly tired—only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open.
   当然，他们现在相当累了；但不是那种痛苦的累——只是慢慢地，感觉非常梦幻和安静，就像一个人在户外漫长的一天即将结束时那样。

6. **河流的变化**：
   - 由于融雪，河流变成了汹涌的黄色洪水，他们不得不离开河谷，转向南方前往石桌的地方。
   Even if this had not been their way they couldn’t have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood—a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood—and their path would have been under water.
   即使这不是他们的路线，一旦解冻开始，他们也无法保持在河谷中，因为所有的融雪使得河流很快变成了汹涌的黄色洪水——一条壮观、咆哮、雷鸣般的黄色洪水——他们的路径会被淹没。

7. **日落时分**：
   - 太阳开始下山，光线变红，影子变长，花朵开始闭合。河狸带领他们上山穿过深而弹性的苔藓，那里只有高大的树木，间隔很宽。
   And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the flowers began to think about closing.
   现在太阳变低了，光线变红了，影子变长了，花朵开始考虑闭合。

通过这些细节，我们可以看到春天的到来给纳尼亚带来了新的希望，同时也揭示了白女巫的魔法被打破，阿斯兰的力量正在发挥作用。孩子们和河狸的旅程虽然疲惫，但充满了期待和希望。
<br/>
### 分段10
在这一段中，彼得、苏珊、露西和海狸夫妇终于到达了山顶，他们看到了一片开阔的绿地，可以俯瞰到无边无际的森林，除了正东方向，那里是闪烁着光芒的大海。山顶中央有一块古老的石桌，上面刻满了神秘的符号和图案。他们还看到了一个华丽的帐篷，帐篷上飘扬着一面红色的狮子旗帜。

他们听到了音乐声，转向声音的方向，看到了他们此行的目标——阿斯兰。阿斯兰站在一群生物中间，这些生物围绕着他形成了一个半圆形。其中有树女和井女，她们手持弦乐器演奏音乐。还有四匹巨大的半人马、一只独角兽、一头人头牛身的怪物、一只鹈鹕和一只鹰，以及一只大狗。阿斯兰的两侧站着两只豹子，一只拿着他的王冠，另一只拿着他的旗帜。

当孩子们和海狸夫妇看到阿斯兰时，他们感到既敬畏又激动，不知道该如何是好。他们发现无法直视阿斯兰的脸，只能看到他金色的鬃毛和庄严的眼睛，然后就感到全身发抖。

海狸先生轻声催促他们上前，但大家都推让着，最后彼得意识到自己应该带头。他拔出剑，举剑致敬，并鼓励其他人振作起来，然后走向狮子，说：

“我们来了——阿斯兰。”
“欢迎，彼得，亚当之子，”阿斯兰说。“欢迎，苏珊和露西，夏娃之女。欢迎，海狸先生和海狸太太。”

They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction—except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. “By gum!” whispered Peter to Susan, “the sea!” In the very middle of this open hilltop was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of gray stone supported on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language. They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was—and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it—with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion fluttering in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.

Aslan stood in the center of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves round him in the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great Dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.

But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn’t know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan’s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn’t look at him and went all trembly.

“Go on,” whispered Mr. Beaver.
“No,” whispered Peter, “you first.”
“No, Sons of Adam before animals,” whispered Mr. Beaver back again.
“Susan,” whispered Peter, “what about you? Ladies first.”
“No, you’re the eldest,” whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realized that it was up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others “Come on. Pull yourselves together,” he advanced to the Lion and said:

“We have come—Aslan.”
“Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,” said Aslan. “Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.”
