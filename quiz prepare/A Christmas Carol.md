## 故事梗概

### 分段1
故事梗概：

1. 斯克鲁奇的恐惧与怀疑：
   - 地窖门突然打开，发出轰鸣声，随后斯克鲁奇听到楼下传来更大的噪音，然后声音直奔他的房门而来。
   - 斯克鲁奇起初认为这只是假象，不相信会有什么奇怪的事情发生。
   - The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.
   - ‘It’s humbug still!’ said Scrooge. ‘I won’t believe it.’

2. 马利的鬼魂出现：
   - 尽管斯克鲁奇试图否认，但他的脸色变了，因为那声音穿过厚重的门，直接进入他的房间。
   - 鬼魂进入房间时，即将熄灭的火焰突然跳跃起来，仿佛在说：“我认识他！马利的鬼魂！”然后又熄灭了。
   - His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes.
   - Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, ‘I know him! Marley’s Ghost!’ and fell again.

3. 安东尼·霍洛维茨的介绍：
   - 安东尼·霍洛维茨在引言中分享了他对查尔斯·狄更斯的看法，提到他最初对狄更斯的作品感到沉重和难以理解。
   - 他强调狄更斯是一个伟大的故事讲述者，创造了许多令人难忘的角色，如《圣诞颂歌》中的斯克鲁奇。
   - I didn’t always love Charles Dickens. The first book of his that I read – it was Hard Times – landed on my desk with a dull thud and a small cloud of dust when I was at school, aged about sixteen, and I’m afraid I found it very heavy-going.
   - Because what is really great about Dickens is that he was a wonderful storyteller with ghosts, murderers, lunatics, lovers, revolting villains, dashing heroes, eccentric aunts and lovable rogues leaping across the pages.

4. 狄更斯的自序：
   - 狄更斯在序言中表示，他在这本小书中试图唤起一个不会让读者感到不快或失望的想法，希望这本书能愉快地萦绕在读者的家中。
   - I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.
   - May it haunt their house pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.

5. 马利的死亡与斯克鲁奇的关系：
   - 马利确实已经去世，这一点毫无疑问。斯克鲁奇是马利的唯一执行人、管理人、受让人、遗产继承人、朋友和哀悼者。
   - Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
   - Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend and sole mourner.

当钟声敲响一次时，房间突然亮起，床帘被拉开。斯克鲁奇惊讶地发现自己面对着一个超自然的访客，这个幽灵看起来像一个孩子，但又像一个老人，通过某种超自然的媒介显得遥远而缩小。幽灵的头发是白色的，脸上没有皱纹，皮肤上有最柔和的色彩。它的手臂和手非常长且有力，腿部和脚部则非常精致。它穿着纯白色的束腰外衣，腰间系着一条闪亮的腰带，手持一枝新鲜的冬青树枝，尽管是冬天的象征，但它的服装上装饰着夏天的花朵。最奇怪的是，从它的头顶喷出一束明亮的光，使这一切清晰可见。

斯克鲁奇询问这个幽灵是否就是预言中要来的那个，幽灵回答说它是“过去圣诞节的幽灵”。斯克鲁奇请求幽灵戴上帽子，但幽灵拒绝了，因为它不想被人用世俗的手熄灭它带来的光。幽灵告诉斯克鲁奇，它来是为了他的福祉和救赎。

幽灵轻轻地抓住斯克鲁奇的手臂，带他穿过墙壁，来到一个开阔的乡村道路，城市的痕迹完全消失了。斯克鲁奇惊讶地发现，他曾经在这里长大，这里是他童年的地方。幽灵温和地看着他，它的触摸虽然轻柔且瞬间，但对斯克鲁奇来说，感觉仍然存在。他能够感受到空气中飘浮的每一种气味，每一种都与无数的思绪、希望、欢乐和忧虑相连。

故事梗概：

1. 斯克鲁奇与一个年轻女子对话，女子指出他变了，不再是从前的他。
   - “我们的契约是旧的，当我们都贫穷但满足时订立的，直到我们能通过勤劳改善我们的境况。你变了。当时，你是另一个人。”
   - "Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man."

2. 女子表达了她对这段关系的思考，并决定释放他，因为她认为他们的爱已经不再像以前那样纯粹。
   - “我常常深刻地思考这一点，我不说多少次。已经足够了，我已经思考过，并且可以释放你。”
   - "How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you."

6. 父亲带着圣诞玩具和礼物回家，孩子们兴奋地迎接他，场面更加热闹。
   - “然后是欢呼和挣扎，以及对无防御的搬运工的攻击！用椅子作为梯子爬上他，抢走他的棕色纸包裹，紧紧抓住他的领带，拥抱他的脖子，捶打他的背，踢他的腿，无法抑制的喜爱！每个包裹被打开时收到的惊叹和喜悦的呼喊！”
   - "Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round the neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received!"

7. 斯克鲁奇更加专注地观察，当他看到家里的主人与女儿和妻子坐在火炉旁，他感到非常模糊。
   - “现在斯克鲁奇更加专注地观察，当家里的主人，女儿依偎在他身边，与她和她的母亲坐在他的火炉旁；当他想到这样一个完全优雅和充满希望的生物，可能会称他为父亲，并成为他生命中严冬的春天，他的视线变得非常模糊。”
   - "And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed."
