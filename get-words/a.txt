I. Up and About
ON ROCKY ISLANDS gulls woke. Time to be about their business. Silently they
floated in on the town, but when their icy eyes sighted the first dead fish, first
bits of garbage about the ships and wharves, they began to scream and quarrel.
The cocks in Boston back yards had long before cried the coming of day.
Now the hens were also awake, scratching, clucking,
Cats in malt houses, granaries, ship holds, mansions, and hovels caught a
last mouse, settled down to wash their fur and sleep. Cats did not work by day.
In stables horses shook their halters and whinnied.
In barns cows lowed to be milked.
Boston slowly opened its eyes, stretched, and woke. The sun struck in
horizontally from the east, flashing upon weathervanes—brass cocks and
arrows, here a glass-eyed Indian, there a copper grasshopper—and the bells in
the steeples cling-clanged, telling the people it was time to be up and about.
In hundreds of houses sleepy women woke sleepier children. Get up and to
work. Ephraim, get to the pump, fetch Mother water. Ann, get to the barn, milk
the cow and drive her to the Common. Start the fire, Silas. Put on a clean shirt,
James. Dolly, if you aren't up before I count ten...
And so, in a crooked little house at the head of Hancock's Wharf on
crowded Fish Street, Mrs. Lapham stood at the foot of a ladder leading to the
attic where her father-in-law's apprentices slept. These boys were luckier than
most apprentices. Their master was too feeble to climb ladders; the middleaged mistress too stout. It was only her bellows that could penetrate to their
quarters—not her heavy hands.
'Boys?'
No answer.
'Dove?'
'Coming, ma'am.' Dove turned over for one more snooze.
Frustrated, she shook the ladder she was too heavy to climb. She wished
she could shake 'them limbs of Satan.'
'Dusty Miller—let me hear your voice.'
'Here it is,' piped Dusty pertly.
Her voice changed to pleading.
'Johnny—you get them two lazy lug-a-beds up. Get them down here. You
pull that worthless Dove right out'er bed. You give Dusty a kick for me. I'm
waiting for him to fetch fresh water so's I can get on with breakfast.'
Johnny Tremain was on his feet. He did not bother to answer his mistress.
He turned to the fat, pale, almost white-haired boy still wallowing in bed.
'Hear that, Dove?'
'Oh—you ... leave me lay, can't you?' Grumbling, he swung his legs out of
the bed the three boys shared.
Johnny was already in his leather breeches, pulling on his coarse shirt,
tucking in the tails. He was a rather skinny boy, neither large nor small for
fourteen. He had a thin, sleep-flushed face, light eyes, a wry mouth, and fair,
lank hair. Although two years younger than the swinish Dove, inches shorter,
pounds lighter, he knew, and old Mr. Lapham knew, busy Mrs. Lapham and
her four daughters and Dove and Dusty also knew, that Johnny Tremain was
boss of the attic, and almost of the house.
Dusty Miller was eleven. It was easy for Johnny to say, 'Look sharp,
Dusty,' and little Dusty looked sharp. But Dove (his first name had long ago
been forgotten) hated the way the younger apprentice lorded it over him,
telling him when to go to bed, when to get up, criticizing his work in the
silversmith's shop as though he were already a master smith. Hadn't he been
working four years for Mr. Lapham and Johnny only two? Why did the boy
have to be so infernally smart with his hands—and his tongue?
'Look here, Johnny, I'm not getting up 'cause you tell me to. I'm getting up
'cause Mrs. Lapham tells me to.'
'All right,' said Johnny blandly, 'just so you're up.'
There was only one window in the attic. Johnny always stood before it as
he dressed. He liked this view down the length of Hancock's Wharf. Counting
houses, shops, stores, sail lofts, and one great ship after another, home again
after their voyaging, content as cows waiting to be milked. He watched the
gulls, so fierce and beautiful, fighting and screaming among the ships. Beyond
the wharf was the sea and the rocky islands where gulls nested.
He knew to the fraction of a moment how long it would take the two other
boys to get into their clothes. Swinging about, he leaped for the head of the
ladder, hardly looking where he went. One of Dove's big feet got there first.
Johnny stumbled, caught himself, and swung silently about at Dove.
'Gosh, Johnny. I'm sorry,' snickered Dove.
'Sorry, eh?...you're going to be a lot sorrier...'
'I just didn't notice...'
'You do that again and I'll beat you up again. You overgrown pig-of-alouse. You...' He went on from there. Mr. Lapham was strict about his boys
swearing, but Johnny could get along very well without. Whatever a 'pig-of-alouse' was, it did describe the whitish, flaccid, parasitic Dove.
Little Dusty froze as the older boys quarreled. He knew Johnny could beat
up Dove any time he chose. He worshiped Johnny and did not like Dove, but
he and Dove were bound together by their common servitude to Johnny's
autocratic rule. Half of Dusty sympathized with one boy, half of him with the
other, in this quarrel. It seemed to him that everybody liked Johnny. Old Mr.
Lapham because he was so clever at his work. Mrs. Lapham because he was
reliable. The four Lapham girls because he sassed them so—and then grinned.
Most of the boys in the other shops around Hancock's Wharf liked Johnny,
although some of them fought him on sight. Only Dove hated him. Sometimes
he would get Dusty in a corner, tell him in a hoarse whisper how he was going
to get a pair of scissors and cut out Johnny Tremain's heart. But he never dared
do more than trip him—and then whine out of it.
'Someday,' said Johnny, his good nature restored, 'I'll kill you, Dove. In the
meantime, you have your uses. You get out the buckets and run to North
Square and fetch back drinking water.'
The Laphams were on the edge of the sea. Their well was brackish.
'Look here—Mrs. Lapham said Dusty was to go and...'
'Get along with you. Don't you go arguing with me.'
Fetching water, sweeping, helping in the kitchen, tending the annealing
furnace in the shop were the unskilled work the boys did. Already Johnny was
so useful at his bench he could never be spared for such labor. It was over a
year since he had carried charcoal or a bucket of water, touched a broom or
helped Mrs. Lapham brew ale. His ability made him semi-sacred. He knew his
power and reveled in it. He could have easily made friends with stupid Dove,
for Dove was lonely and admired Johnny as well as envied him. Johnny
preferred to bully him.
Johnny, followed by his subdued slaves, slipped down the ladder with an
easy flop. To his left was Mr. Lapham's bedroom. The door was closed. Old
master did not go to work these days until after breakfast. Starting the boys off,
getting things going, he left to his bustling daughter-in-law. Johnny knew the
old man (whom he liked) was already up and dressed. He took this time every
day to read the Bible.
To his right, the only other bedroom was open. It was here Mrs. Lapham
slept with her four 'poor fatherless girls,' as she called them. The two biggest
and most capable were already in the kitchen helping their mother.
Cilla was sitting on the edge of one of the unmade beds, brushing Isannah's
hair. It was wonderful hair, seemingly spun out of gold. It was the most
wonderful thing in the whole house. Gently Cilla brushed and brushed, her
little oddly shaped face turned away, pretending she did not know that Johnny
was there. He knew neither Cilla nor Isannah would politely wish him the
conventional 'good morning.' He was lingering for his morning insult.
Cilla never lifted her eyes as she put down her brush and very deliberately
picked up a hair ribbon (the Laphams couldn't afford such luxuries, but
somehow Cilla always managed to keep her little sister in hair ribbons). Very
carefully she began to tie the child's halo of pale curls. She spoke to Isannah in
so low a voice it was almost a whisper.
'There goes that wonderful Johnny Tremain.'
Isannah took her cue, already so excited she was jumping up and down.
'Johnny worth-his-weight-in-gold Tremain.'
'If you don't think he is wonderful—ask him, Isannah.'
'Oh, just how wonderful are you, Johnny?'
Johnny said nothing, stood there and grinned.
The two youngest Laphams were always insulting him, not only about how
smart he was, but how smart he thought he was. He didn't care. Every now and
then they would say something that irritated him and then together they would
shout, 'Johnny's mad.'
As an apprentice he was little more than a slave until he had served his
master seven years. He had no wages. The very clothes upon his back
belonged to his master, but he did not, as he himself said, 'take much.'
There were only four real rooms in the Lapham house, the two bedrooms
on the second floor, the kitchen and the workshop on the first. Johnny paused
in the lower entry. In the kitchen he could see his formidable mistress bent
double over the hearth. Madge, in time, would look like her mother, but at
eighteen she was handsome in a coarse-grained, red-faced, thick-waisted way.
Dorcas was sixteen, built like Madge, but not so loud-voiced, nor as roughly
good-natured. Poor Dorcas thirsted for elegance. She would rub flour on her
face, trying to look pale, like the fashionable ladies she saw on the street. She
wore her clothes so tight (hoping to look ethereal), she looked apoplectic. How
they all had laughed when her stays burst in the middle of meeting with a loud
pop! She did not call her mother 'Ma,' but 'Mother,' or 'Respected Mother'; and
in her efforts to avoid the rough, easy speech of her associates on Hancock's
Wharf she talked (when she remembered it) in a painfully prissy, proper way.
Johnny thought Madge pretty bad, and Dorcas even worse. But he was
philosophical about them. He wouldn't mind having them for sisters. They
certainly were good hard workers—except when Dorcas tried too hard to be
elegant.
It had already been decided that when he grew up to be a really great
silversmith (as Mr. Lapham said he would), he was to marry Cilla and together
they would inherit Grandpa's silver business. Cilla was just his age. This idea
seemed only mildly offensive to both of them. Johnny had no particular
objections. Smart apprentices were always getting ahead by marrying into their
masters' families. He had been flattered when Mrs. Lapham had told him that
he might marry one of her girls. Of course, Madge and Dorcas (they were fine,
big buxom girls) would make better wives. But didn't he think they were a
little old for him? True, Cilla was just a mite spindly—but she was coming
along fine. Isannah was so weakly it didn't seem worth making any plans for
her maturity. So it was to be Cilla.
Johnny had often heard Mrs. Lapham say that Isannah was hardly worth
the bother she was to raise. The little girl, her beautiful brown eyes wide with
interest, never seemed to mind these remarks of her mother, but they made
Cilla cry. Cilla loved Isannah. She was proud when people stopped her on the
street and said, 'Is that little angel your sister?' She did not mind that there
were so many things Isannah could not 'keep down'—like pork gravy, mince
pies, new beer. If Isannah got wet, she had a cold—if a cold, a fever.
First Johnny, with a customary 'Look sharp,' got the sulky Dove and his
buckets headed for North Square. Then he took the key to the shop out of his
pocket as though he owned it. Dusty, good and quiet as a mouse, followed him.
'Look sharp, Dusty,' Johnny said. 'Get the annealing furnace going. Get to
the coal house. Fetch in charcoal. You'll have to do it by yourself. I want to get
this buckle mended before breakfast.'
Already the day's bustle had begun up and down the wharf: A man was
crying fish. Sailors were heave-hoing at their ropes. A woman was yelling that
her son had fallen into the water. A parrot said distinctly, 'King Hancock.'
Johnny could smell hemp and spices, tar and salt water, the sun drying
fish. He liked his wharf. He sat at his own bench, before him the innumerable
tools of his trade. The tools fitted into his strong, thin hands: his hands fitted
the tools. Mr. Lapham was always telling him to give God thanks who had
seen fit to make him so good an artisan—not to take it out in lording it over the
other boys. That was one of the things Johnny 'did not let bother him much.'
Dove came back, his thick lower lip thrust out. The water had slopped over
his breeches, down his legs.
'Mrs. Lapham does not want you in the kitchen?'—Johnny did not even
look up from his buckle.
'Naw.'
'Well, then, this spoon you finished yesterday afternoon has to be melted
down—made over. You beat it to the wrong gauge.'
'Did Mr. Lapham say 'twas wrong?'
'No, but it is. It is supposed to match this spoon. Look at it.'
Dove looked. There was no argument.
'So get out a crucible. 'Soon as Dusty's got the furnace going, you melt it
down and try again.'
I'd like to get you in a crucible, thought Dove, and melt you down. I'd beat
you to the proper gauge ... Two years younger than me and look at him!
It was Isannah who ran in to tell them that Grandpa was in his chair and
breakfast was on the table. The soft brown eyes combined oddly with the
flying fair hair. She did look rather like a little angel, Johnny thought—just as
people were always telling Cilla on the street—and so graceful. She seemed to
float about rather than run.
No one, to see her, would ever guess the number of things she couldn't
keep down.
2
Mr. Lapham, as befitted his venerable years and his dignity as master of the
house, sat in an armchair at the head of the table. He was a peaceful, kind,
remote old man. Although his daughter-in-law was always nagging him to
collect bills, finish work when promised, and discipline his apprentices,
nothing she said seemed to touch him. He did not even bother to listen.
His dull, groping eyes lingered kindly over his boys as they trooped in for
breakfast.
'Good morning, Dove, Dusty. Good morning, Johnny.'
'Good morning, sir.'
He took his time blessing the meal. He was a deacon at the Cockerel
Church and very pious.
Breakfast was good, although no more than a poor artisan could afford—
milk and ale, gruel, sausages, and corn bread. Everything was plentiful and
well cooked. The kitchen was as clean or cleaner than many of those in the
great houses. Every member of the household had a clean shirt or petticoat.
Mrs. Lapham was a great manager, but she cared nothing for genteel manners
and was the first to laugh at Dorcas's 'If it please you, Mother—just a touch
more maple syrup for me.' 'Gimme that there syrup pitcher' was good enough
for her.
When the meal was over, Mr. Lapham told Madge to hand him the family
Bible.
'Johnny, I'm going to ask you to read to us today.'
Of the three boys, only Johnny read easily and well. His mother had lived
long enough to see to that. Dove stumbled shamefully. Dusty usually had the
first chapter of Genesis, so that by reading the same thing over and over he
might eventually learn.
Madge and Dorcas never cared even to try to read. Mrs. Lapham could not
so much as write her name. 'Book larning,' she declared, 'scalded no pigs.'
Cilla was so anxious to learn (and teach Isannah) that whenever Johnny read
she leaned over the book and shaped the words to herself as he said them.
They sat beside each other at table. To help her Johnny always kept a finger on
the lines as he read.
Johnny now opened the book, keeping it between himself and Cilla.
'Where, sir, shall I read?'
Mr. Lapham's selections for his boys were sometimes designed to point out
some fault in a member of his household, especially in the reader. Dove was
always being asked to read about sluggards and going to ants.
Johnny was told where to begin in Leviticus.
'Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a
standing image ...' (What was old master driving at? Couldn't a silversmith put
a dragon's snout on a chocolate pot?)
Soon the surging roll of the words, the pleasure of the sound of his voice
coming so clearly out of his mouth, made him stop looking for possible object
lessons in the text. Cilla was leaning over him, breathing hard in her efforts to
keep up. Mrs. Lapham sat agape. Soon she'd be saying it was just like having a
preacher live with them to hear Johnny Tremain read Holy Writ.
'Finish with the nineteenth verse.'
'... And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven
as iron, and your earth as brass.'
'Turn to Proverbs eleven, second verse.'
'When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.'
'Proverbs sixteen, eighteenth.'
'Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.'
'Now close the book. Stand up and expound to us all the meaning of God's
Word.'
Johnny stood up. His skin was thin and he could feel himself flush. So the
old gentleman was after him for his pride again, was he?
'It is all another way of saying—God's way of saying—that pride goeth
before a fall.'
'Yes, and why?'
'Because God doesn't like pride.' Johnny sounded sulky.
'Do you think God would like you?'
'Not especially.'
Dusty was the first to snicker.
'What does God like?'
'Humble people,' said Johnny wrathfully. 'He sends punishments to people
who are too proud.'
'Now, Johnny, I want you to raise your right hand and repeat after me, "I,
Johnny Tremain..." '
'I, Johnny Tremain...'
'Swear from this day onward...'
'Swear from this day onward...'
'To walk more humbly and modestly before God and man.'
'To walk more humbly and modestly before God and man.'
'Just because some folks are not so smart' (the old master gave Dove and
Dusty a pitying glance), 'it's no reason why other folks should go around
rubbing their noses in their own stupidities.'
Either Dove or Dusty kicked Johnny under the table. Madge and Dorcas
were giggling. Mrs. Lapham was already scraping the trenchers clean, getting
on with her work. She did not hold much by Grandpa's soul-searchings.
The master, followed by Dove and Dusty, left for the shop.
Johnny heard Cilla give an exaggeratedly pious sigh. He stopped.
'When the meek inherit the earth,' she said, 'I doubt Johnny gets as much as
one divot of sod.'
This was too much for Johnny. He turned on the little girls.
When they do!' he stormed. 'Cill, you can just about keep your mouth shut
until then.'
'You know you did look pretty funny standing up there, and saying all
those humble things Grandpa told you to.'
Isannah was almost jumping out of her pinafore in glee.
'Johnny's mad,' she chanted. 'Johnny's mad.'
'Yes,' murmured Cilla, looking at him critically, 'you're right, baby dear.
His ears are red. That always means he's mad.'
'Johnny's ears are red,' squealed Isannah.
Johnny stalked out of the kitchen as stiff-legged as a fighting tom-cat. His
ears were scarlet.
3
He decided to do nothing that would lay him open to such criticism for at least
a morning, but he couldn't help it. First, if he had not jumped on Dusty, the
furnace would have gone out. Then he had to explain to his master how badly
Dove had done the spoon. Although he tried to sound humble, he was soon
behaving perfectly naturally, standing over Mr. Lapham with his notebook in
his hand, reading off exactly how those spoons had been ordered.
Mr. Lapham was a fine craftsman. His weakness was that he never wrote
down what was ordered or even listened very carefully. If a patron ordered a
sauceboat, he would get a fine one—perhaps a month after it had been
promised. Sometimes it weighed a little more, sometimes a little less, than it
was supposed to. Sometimes it had splayed feet when a gadroon edge had been
asked for. Mrs. Lapham herself had told Johnny he must always be on hand
and write down exactly what the order was. This was necessary, but it did
seem cheeky to see the fourteen-year-old boy standing there, telling his master
what he was supposed to do.
Johnny, having started everybody off on his work (even Mr. Lapham),
decided to go to the coal house and see if he should order more charcoal. It
was such things Mr. Lapham never thought about until too late.
There were two basketfuls of charcoal and at least half another scattered
over the floor. That was the other boys' fault. Johnny himself was too valuable
to carry charcoal. He started to yell for Dusty, thought better of it, and went to
work arranging the dirty stuff himself.
When he was a master craftsman, he wasn't going to buy charcoal by the
basket. He was going to own his own willows—say, out in Milton. That would
save—say, twopence a basket. In a year—he began to figure. And he wouldn't
take just any boy whose father or mother wanted him to be a silversmith. He'd
pick and choose. He saw himself sitting at his bench, his shop crowded with
boys with mothers, boys with fathers, all begging to be allowed to work for
him. He'd not talk to the parents—only to the boys. What church did they go
to? King's Chapel? All right. Describe to me at least one piece of silver you see
used every Lord's Supper. If they could not answer that, he'd know they hadn't
got silver in their blood. But how could he find which boys had nice hands...?
'Johnny!' It was Madge's voice that pulled him out of his reverie.
He wiped his black hands on his leather breeches and stepped out into the
sunlight of the tiny back yard.
'What is it, my girl?' He often thus arrogantly addressed his master's
granddaughters—really his own mistresses.
'Ma sent me. Johnny, it's Mr. Hancock himself. He's in the shop ordering
something. Stand by and listen or Grandpa will get it wrong.'
Dorcas next flung herself upon him, too excited to be elegant.
'Johnny, hurry, hurry! It's Mr. Hancock. He's ordering a sugar basin. Can't
you go faster? Shake a leg.'
Isannah was jumping about him like a wild thing.
'Help, help!' she shrieked.
But it was Cilla who thought to offer him her clean apron for a towel as he
washed off the charcoal at the yard pump.
Oh, but he must hurry! And there was Mrs. Lapham tapping at him from
the kitchen window. Slowly he approached the house, the girls chattering about
him.
Close to the shop door was a tiny African holding a slender gray horse by
the bridle. Johnny noted the Hancock arms on the door of the gig. He felt so
good he could not help saying to the black child, 'Mind that horse doesn't
trample our flowers.'
There were no flowers in the Laphams' yard.
'Oh, no, sir,' said little Jehu, rolling his eyes. He thought, from the attention
this boy was receiving from his escorting ladies, he must be a boy of
consequence.
Johnny slipped into the shop so quietly that Mr. Hancock did not even look
up. It was he who owned this great wharf, the warehouses, many of the fine
ships tied up along it. He owned sail lofts and shops, and also dwelling houses
standing at the head of the wharf. He owned the Lapham house. He was the
richest man in New England. Such a wealthy patron might lift the Laphams
from poverty to affluence.
Mr. Hancock was comfortably seated in the one armchair which was kept
in the shop for patrons. (When I'm master, thought Johnny, there are going to
be two armchairs—and I'll sit in one.)
Unobtrusively Johnny got his notebook and pencil. Dove and Dusty were
paralyzed into complete inaction. 'Do something,' Johnny muttered to them,
determined his master's shop should look busy. Dusty could not take his eyes
off the green velvet coat, sprigged white waistcoat, silver buttons and buckles
on the great man, but he picked up a soldering iron and nervously dropped it.
'...and to be done next Monday—a week from today,' Mr. Hancock was
saying. 'I want it as a birthday present to my venerable Aunt Lydia Hancock.
This is the creamer of the set. Only this morning a clumsy maid melted the
sugar basin. I want you to make me a new one. I want it about so high ... so
broad...' Johnny glanced at the delicate, lace-ruffled, gesturing hands, guessed
the inches, and wrote it down.
Mr. Lapham was looking down at his own gnarled fingers. He nodded and
said nothing. He did not even glance at the cream pitcher as Mr. Hancock set it
down on a workbench. Johnny's hard, delicate hands, so curiously strong and
mature for his age, reached quickly to touch the beautiful thing. It was almost
as much by touch as by sight he judged fine silver. It was indeed oldfashioned, more elaborate than the present mode. The garlands on it were
rounded out in repoussé work. Mr. Lapham would have to do the repousséing.
Johnny hadn't been taught that. He looked at the handle. A sugar basin would
have to have two such handles and they would be larger than the one on the
creamer. He'd shape it in wax, make a mold. He had cast hundreds of small
things since he had gone to work for Mr. Lapham, but nothing so intricate and
beautiful as the woman with folded wings whose body formed the handle. He
thought he had never seen anything quite so enchanting as this pitcher. It must
have been the work of one of the great smiths of forty or fifty years ago.
Although he had not intended to address Mr. Hancock, he had said, before he
thought, 'John Coney, sir?'
Mr. Hancock turned to him. He had a handsome face, a little worn, as
though either his health was bad or he did not sleep well.
'Look at the mark, boy.'
Johnny turned it over, expecting to see the familiar rabbit of the great Mr.
Coney. Instead, there was a pellet, and 'L,' and a pellet.
'Your master made that creamer—forty years ago. He made the entire set.'
'You made it!' He had never guessed there had been a time when Mr.
Lapham could do such beautiful work.
At last Mr. Lapham raised his protuberant eyes. 'I remember when your
uncle, Mr. Thomas Hancock, sir, ordered that set. "Make it big, and make it
handsome," he said, "bigger and handsomer than anything in Boston. As big
and handsome as my lady is. Make it as rich as I am." '
John Hancock laughed. 'That is just the way my uncle used to talk.' He was
so sure of his own good breeding, he could laugh affectionately at the richquick vulgarities of the uncle who had adopted him and from whom he had
inherited his fortune.
He stood up—a tall, slender man, who stooped as he stood and walked.
The fine clothes seemed a little pathetic. He had a soft voice, and low.
'But you have not as yet said whether or not you can make my sugar basin
for me—and have it done by Monday next? Of course I thought first of you—
because you made the original. But there are other silversmiths. Perhaps you
would rather not undertake...'
Mr. Lapham was in a study. 'I've got the time, the materials, and the boys
to help. I can get right at it. But honestly, sir ... I don't know. Perhaps I haven't
got the skill any more. I've not done anything so fine for thirty years. I'm not
what I used to be, and...'
Although neither of the two men could see the door leading from the hall
into the shop, Johnny could. There was Mrs. Lapham in her morning apron,
her face purple with excitement, and all four girls crowded about her listening,
gesturing at Johnny. 'Say yes,' all five faces (big and little) mouthed at him.
'Yes ... yes ... yes.'
So they had forgotten morning prayers, had they? Wanted him to take
charge.
'We can do it, Mr. Hancock.'
'Bless me,' exclaimed the gentleman, not accustomed to apprentices who
settled matters while their masters pondered.
'Yes, sir. And you shall have it delivered at your own house a week from
today, seven o'clock Monday morning. And it's going to be just exactly right.'
Mr. Lapham looked at Johnny gratefully. 'Certainly, sir. I'm humbly
grateful for your august patronage.' He was not a proud man. He was relieved
that Johnny had stepped in and settled matters.
Mr. Hancock bowed and turned to go, but none of the boys thought to run
ahead and open the door for him, so Mrs. Lapham, apron and all, barged in,
her red arms bare to the elbow, her felt slippers flapping at her bare heels, and
did (or overdid) the courtesies for them all.
Hardly was the door closed than there was a rap on it. Little Jehu came
mincing in, a glitter of bright colors. He solemnly laid three pieces of silver on
the nearest bench and recited his piece.
'My master, Mr. John Hancock, Esquire, bids me leave these coins—one
for each of the poor work-boys—hoping they will drink his health and be
diligent at their benches.' Then he was gone.
'Hoping they will vote for him—when they are grown up and have enough
property.'
'Don't you ever vote for Mr. Hancock, sir?' asked Johnny.
'I never do. I don't hold much with these fellows that are always trying to
stir up trouble between us and England. Maybe English rule ain't always
perfect, but it's good enough for me. Fellows like Mr. Hancock and Sam
Adams, calling themselves patriots and talking too much. Not reading God's
Word—like their parents did—which tells us to be humble. But he's my
landlord and I don't say much.'
Johnny was not listening. He sat with the pitcher in his hand. To think the
poor, humble old fellow once had been able to make things like that! Well, he
was going to turn the trick again before he died—even if Johnny had to stand
over him and make him.
4
The sun stood directly overhead, pressing its heat down upon the town as
though it held an enormous brass basin. There was not wind enough to take a
catboat from Hancock's Wharf to Noddle Island.
In the Lapham shop windows and doors were left open to catch what
breeze might come up the wharf, but there wasn't any breeze.
Old Mr. Lapham had worked well in the morning. He said if Johnny could
do the handles, he himself could get the basin done in time, but after dinner he
had gone down to the old willow behind the coal house, put a basket over his
head, and gone to sleep. Dove and Dusty had, therefore, left to go swimming.
Johnny was making out of wax an exact replica of the pitcher handle, only
enlarging it. He tried again and again, never quite satisfied with his work, but
confident that he could do it.
It was long past dinner hour when he crossed the entry into the kitchen.
The fire was out. The table cleared except for his place. Cilla had evidently
been left to wait on him whenever he felt like eating. The success of Mr.
Hancock's order was so dependent upon him, no one would scold him today
because he chose to be an hour late. Johnny took his seat and Cilla put down
the slate she had been drawing on. She gave him a piece of cold meat pie, a
flat loaf of rye bread, dried apples, and ran down cellar to fetch him a flagon of
cold ale. He drank the ale, and then more leisurely began on the pie.
With hardly a word Cilla went back to the settle where Isannah was
sprawled and picked up her slate. She drew very well. It would be just about
nothing, Johnny thought, to teach that girl to write.
'She's doing it for you, Johnny,' Isannah said at last.
'What are you doing for me, Cil?'
'She's designing you a beautiful mark so when you are man-grown and
master smith you can stamp your silver with it.'
'I've five more years to go. No matter how good my work may be, I have to
mark it with your grandpa's old pellets and "L's." '
'Johnny's forgotten morning prayers and all those wonderful humble
people,' said Cilla. 'Look, I've got your "J" and "T" sort of entwined.'
'Too hard to read. Then, too' (he could not imagine why he came out with
this secret), 'when I'm master smith I'm going to use all three of my initials.'
All three?'
'J. L. T.'
Neither of the girls had ever heard of a poor working boy with three
names. 'You're not making up?' Cilla asked, almost respectfully. 'I've heard tell
of folk with three names, but I never saw one before.'
'Look at me, my girl.' He got up to go back to the shop.
'Wait, Johnny. What is that middle name? It begins with "L." '
'As far as you are concerned, it ends with "L" too.'
'I'll bet it's something so awful you are ashamed of it, like "Ladybug" or
"Leapfrog." I'll bet it's "Lamentable." '
Johnny grinned, untempted by her insults.
In the shop it was so hot he could not handle the wax. The solitude in
which he worked depressed him a little. For the first time he was afraid he
could not get the handles right. All the shops had stopped work because of the
heat. He could hear the other boys running and splashing, diving off the wharf
into the cold water. He locked the shop. Now even Mr. Lapham would have to
ask him if he wanted to get in, and he ran off to swim. Later, after sunset, he
could get on with the model, even if he had to work by lamplight.
5
When at last he blew out his lamp, Johnny had made an exact replica of the
winged woman, only larger. He looked at it and knew that it was not, for some
reason, quite right. Instead of going up to the attic to sleep, he crossed into the
kitchen and got an old mattress. The clock struck midnight and he was asleep.
He woke and it was still dark night. Someone was in the room with him
and he thought of thieves.
'Who's there!' he yelled roughly.
'It's me. Johnny, I wasn't going to wake you up, if you were already asleep,
but...'
'What's wrong, Cilla?'
'Johnny ... it's Isannah. She's sick again.'
'What does her mother say?'
Cilla began to cry. 'I don't want to tell her. She'd just say p-p-p-oor Ba-aBaby wasn't worth raising.'
Johnny was tired. At the moment he had a sneaking sympathy with Mrs.
Lapham's point of view.
'What seems to be wrong?'
'She's so hot. She says if she can't get a breath of air, she'll throw up.' This
was a very old, but dire threat.
'There might be a little down at the end of the wharf. Fetch her down.'
Seemed it was always like this. Whenever things went wrong and he was
tired, Cilla was after him to help her nurse Isannah. Nevertheless he carried her
in his thin, strong arms. She was a tiny child for eight. The white-gold hair that
he secretly admired so much got into his mouth and he wished she was bald.
Isannah giggled. On one side of the deserted wharf were warehouses, on the
other were ships. Not a person was abroad except themselves. The child grew
heavier and heavier.
'Want to walk now, Isannah? You'd be cooler walking.'
'I like to ride.'
'Well—just so you are satisfied.'
'Johnny,' said Cilla crossly, 'are you being sarcastic to baby?'
'Yes.'
'How do you feel, dear?'
'I feel like I'm going to throw up.'
'Oh, you get down, then,' said Johnny. 'That settles it.' But he carried her to
the very end of the wharf.
Suddenly he felt cool fingers of air lifting the wet, fair hair on his
forehead. The perspiration under his arms, dripping down his chest, evaporated
and the prickly sensation was delightful.
Isannah cried, 'The wind, the wind! Blow, wind, blow!'
It did not blow, but flowed over them and cooled them. The three sat in a
row, their feet dangling over the water below. They sat well apart at first, with
arms outstretched, soaking themselves in the freshness of the sea air.
For a long time they sat and said nothing, then Isannah put her head in
Cilla's lap. Cilla leaned against Johnny. The two girls were almost asleep.
Johnny was wide awake.
'Johnny,' murmured Isannah, 'tell us a story?'
'I don't know any.'
'Johnny,' said Cilla, 'tell us the story of your middle name?'
'It isn't a story; it's just a fact.'
'What is it?'
Although by daytime and if Cilla had teased him, he never would have
told, the darkness of the night, the remoteness of the place where they sat, an
affection he felt for the girls and they for him, made everything seem different.
After a long pause he said, 'It is Lyte.'
'So you are really John Lyte Tremain?'
'No. My baptized Bible name is Jonathan. I've always been called Johnny.
That's the way my papers were made out to your grandpa. I am Jonathan Lyte
Tremain.'
'Why, that's just like Merchant Lyte?'
'Just like.'
'You don't suppose you are related?'
'I do suppose. But I don't know. Lyte's not a common name. And we are
both Jonathan. Of course I've thought about it ... some—When I see him
rolling around in his coach, strutting about with his laces and gold-headed
canes. But I don't aim ever to think too much about it.'
Isannah was almost asleep. 'Tell more, Johnny,' she murmured.
'Merchant Lyte is so very rich...'
'How rich? Like Mr. Hancock?'
'Not quite. Almost. He's so rich gold and silver are like dust to him.'
'You mean at Lyte Mansion Mrs. Lyte sweeps up gold and silver in a
dustpan?'
'Mrs. Lyte doesn't sweep, you silly, not with her own fair hands. For one
thing, she's dead, and for another, if she weren't she'd just snap her fingers and
maids would come running—in frilly starched caps. They'd curtsy and squeak,
"Yes, ma'am," "No, ma'am," and "If it please you, ma'am." Then Mrs. Lyte
would say, "You dirty sluts, look at that gold dust under the bed! I could write
my name in the silver dust on the mirror over that mantel. Fetch your mops
and rags, you bow-legged, cross-eyed, chattering monkeys." '
'Diamonds, too?'
'To clean up diamonds they need brooms.'
'Oh, Johnny! Tell more.'
'Once the rubies spilled and the cook (a monstrous fine woman—I've seen
her) thought they were currants. She put them in a fruit cake, and Merchant
Lyte broke a front tooth on one.'
'A fact, Johnny?'
'Well, it's a fact that Merchant Lyte's got a broken front tooth. I saw it as I
stood watching him.'
Cilla said, 'You watch him much?'
He answered, a little miserably, 'It's just like I can't help it. I don't mean
ever to think of him.'
Isannah murmured, 'What do they do with their pearls?'
'They drink their pearls.'
'What?'
'Like a queen of Egypt my mother told me of—before she died. She drank
her pearls in vinegar—just to show off. That Lavinia Lyte is always showing
off too.'
Isannah was asleep.
'You never speak of your mother, Johnny. She hadn't been dead more'n a
few weeks when you first came here. You never talked about her at all. Was
that because you liked her so much—or not at all.'
There was a long pause. 'Liked her so much,' he said at last. 'We had been
living at Townsend, Maine. She got a living for us both by sewing. But when
she knew she had to die (she had death inside of her and she knew it), she
wanted me taught skilled work, and all I wanted was to be a silversmith. That's
why we came to Boston, so's to get me a proper master. She could still sew, but
she coughed all the time. Even when she was so weak she could hardly hold a
needle, she kept on and on, teaching me reading and writing and all that. She
was determined I shouldn't grow up untaught—like Dove and Dusty. She
wanted me to be something.'
'That's why you work so hard?'
'That's why. Mrs. Lapham promised your grandpa would take me on just as
soon as she was buried. She died—and he did. That's all.'
'What was her name? And how come she—a poor sewing woman—was so
well learned?'
"Roundabout here she called herself just Mrs. Tremain, but she was born
Lavinia Lyte. She came of gentlefolk.'
'Just like Mr. Lyte's daughter?'
'Yes. She told me once that for over a hundred years Lytes have favored
Jonathan and Lavinia as names.'
'Johnny, didn't she ever go to those rich relatives and say, "Here I am"?'
'No. And she told me not to—ever. Unless ... only, if I'd got to the end of
everything. She'd say, "Johnny, if there is not one thing left for you and you
have no trade and no health, and God Himself has turned away His face from
you, then go to Merchant Lyte and show him your cup and tell him your
mother told you before she died that you are kin to him. He will know the
kinship, she said, and in pity he may help you." '
'Your cup?'
'She said I wasn't to sell it—ever. I was to go hungry and cold first.'
'Where is your cup?'
'In my sea chest in the attic. That's why I keep it locked.'
'Will you show me your cup?'
'If you swear by your hope of Heaven and your fear of Hell never, never to
mention any of this to anyone. Never tell my true name, nor that I have a cup.'
'But Isannah?'
'If she's heard anything, she'll think it was a story I made up—like those
rubies in the fruit cake.'
Now it was close to morning. Far off a cock crew. Near-by another
answered. The dawn breeze came up from off the sea and the black night
turned gray. Cilla was shivering and stood up. Johnny shouldered Isannah.
6
He kept his word to Cilla, and, as he was putting the little girl back to bed, he
slipped to the attic, unlocked his chest, and brought down the cup in the flannel
bag his mother had made. He opened the door from the shop to the wharf.
Although still dark inside the house, outside it was growing lighter and lighter.
Gulls flew in from the islands looking for food.
Cilla joined him and he motioned her to follow him out into the twilight of
the new day. He drew his cup from its bag.
As a small child he had thought it was the most beautiful thing in the
world. It was the reason why he had begged his mother to apprentice him to a
silversmith (and there were none in Townsend, Maine). Now he was more
critical of the cup. He thought it too chunky. On one side was engraved the
crest of the Lytes. This was an eye rising up from the sea. From it rays of light
(or lashes) streamed out, half-covering the surface of the cup. It was this
emblem Merchant Lyte had on everything he owned—carved above his
counting house on Long Wharf, engraved on all his silver—even on dog
collars and harnesses. Miss Lavinia had it stamped on her Spanish-leather
gloves. Johnny knew it was cut on the slate gravestones of the Lyte family on
Copp's Hill.
'The same as his,' said Cilla in wonder.
'And the same motto. Look!'
She read the words in her halting manner: 'Let there be Lyte.'
And miraculously, as she stumbled over these words, there was light, for
the sun came up out of the sea.
The children stood and looked at each other. The girl's face showed her
excitement—and her fatigue. It was a pointed, sweet little face, her eyes a
lighter brown than Isannah's and her hair not so strikingly pale.
Johnny whispered, 'Just like the sun coming up yonder out of the sea,
pushing rays of light ahead of it.'
Cilla (evidently thinking Johnny was getting beyond himself) said, 'Might
it not just as well be a setting eye?' It was the first sour remark she had made to
him all the night.
'No, no. My mother said it is a rising eye. But I was to keep whist and
mum about it—unless even God has turned away His face. And Cilla ... you
promised.'
'By my hope of Heaven and my fear of Hell.'

II. The Pride of Your Power
THE WEEK wore on, each day as hot as the one before, for it was July. Every
day after dinner Mr. Lapham took a long nap under his basket snoring as
gently as he did everything else. Johnny would let him sleep for an hour,
then wake him up, scold him, and get him to work. His work was beautiful.
The body of the sugar basin was quickly completed and he began
repousseing on it the rich garlands of fruit with the same skill he had had
forty years before.
Johnny's own work did not satisfy him as well. He had exactly enlarged
the handle in his wax model. Mrs. Lapham and the girls, even Mr. Lapham,
said it was fine, and he could go ahead and cast it in silver. It was only
Johnny himself who was dissatisfied.
Friday evening, when the light was failing and work over, Johnny took
the silver pitcher and his own wax model and left the shop. He was in Fish
Street, in a minute stopping outside the silver shop of Paul Revere. He
didn't dare knock, but he knew that any moment now the silversmith would
be closing his shop, leaving for his dwelling in near-by North Square. He
was so prosperous a smith that he did not live and work in the same place.
So at last he saw Mr. Revere, a stocky, ruddy man, with fine, dark eyes,
shutting his shop, taking out his key preparing to lock up.
'Good evening, Mr. Revere.' The man smiled with a quick flash of white
teeth. He had a quick smile and a quick face and body.
'Good evening, Johnny Tremain.' The boy had long admired Mr. Revere
as the best craftsman in Boston. He had no idea Mr. Revere knew his name.
He did not know all the master silversmiths had an eye on him.
'Mr. Revere, I'd like to talk with you.'
'Man to man,' Mr. Revere agreed, opening his shop door, motioning
Johnny to follow him.
Johnny's eyes flew about the shop, taking in the fine anvils, the hood
upon the annealing furnace, the neat nests of crucibles. It was just such a
shop he would himself have when he was man-grown. Not much like Mr.
Lapham's.
Although Paul Revere was as busy a man as there was in all Boston, he
took everything so easily in his stride (doing the one thing after another)
that he never seemed rushed, so now, because an apprentice stopped him on
the street and said he wanted to talk to him, he appeared to have all the time
in the world.
'Sir,' said Johnny, 'it's a matter of handles.' He took the silver pitcher out
of the cloth he had wrapped it in and his own wax model and explained Mr.
Hancock's order.
'So you want to talk to me as a silversmith to silversmith, do you?' He
had Johnny's wax model in his hands—delicate hands to go with such
heavy wrists. 'What does your master say of your work?'
'Mr. Lapham won't even look at it much. But he says it's good enough
and I can go ahead and cast tomorrow. I've got to cast tomorrow because it's
Saturday and we can't work Sunday, and it must be done Monday at seven.
Although my master thinks it's all right, I'm not sure...'
'He is wrong and you are right. Look, you've just copied the handle on
the pitcher too slavishly—just enlarged it. Don't you see that your winged
woman looks coarse in comparison? I'd have the figures the same size on
both pieces—fill in with a scroll. Then, too, your curve is wrong. The basin
is so much bigger you cannot use the same curve. Yours looks hunched up
and awkward. It's all a matter of proportion.' He took up a piece of paper
and a pencil and drew off what he meant with one sure sweep of his hand.
'I'd use a curve more like that—see? This is what I meant when I said I'd
add a scroll or two below the figure of the winged woman—not just enlarge
her so she looks like a Boston fishwife in comparison to the angel on the
pitcher. See?'
'I see.'
The man looked at him a little curiously.
'There was a time,' he said, 'when your own master could have shown
you that.'
'Mr. Lapham is ... well ... he's feeble.'
'Not doing very much work these days?'
'Not what you'd call much.' Johnny felt on the defensive. 'Not much fine
hollow ware. Plenty of buckles, spoons, and such.'
'How many boys?'
'Three of us, sir.'
'I'd hardly think he'd need three. Now, if he wants to cut down, you tell
him from me that I'll buy your unexpired time. I think between us we could
make some fine things—you and I.'
The boy flushed. To think the great Paul Revere wanted him!
'Tell your master I'll pay a bit more than is usual for you. Don't let him
shunt one of those other boys off on me.'
He stood up. It was time for Johnny to go.
'I couldn't leave the Laphams, sir,' he said as he thanked Mr. Revere. 'If
it wasn't for me, nothing would ever get done. They'd just about starve.'
'I see. You're right, of course. But if the old gentleman dies or you ever
want a new master, remember my offer. So...' and he turned to shake hands,
'may we meet again.'
2
By Saturday noon, Johnny, following Mr. Revere's advice and his curve,
had got the model of the handle exactly right. He could tell with his eyes
closed. It felt perfect. He rapidly made a duplicate, for when the molten
silver was poured in on the wax, it would melt and float away, so he made a
model for each handle.
Now, no matter how long it took him (and if all went well it should not
be too long), he must get his handles cast, cleaned, and soldered to the basin
itself which Mr. Lapham had made. Of course, on Sunday the shop would
be locked up all day, the furnace cold. Mr. Lapham would as always escort
his household, dressed in Sunday best, to the Cockerel Church and after that
back for a cold dinner. Whether they went again or not to afternoon
meeting, the master left for each to decide. He himself always went. Madge
and Dorcas usually entertained their beaux. Mrs. Lapham slept. Cilla would
take Isannah out along the little beach. Johnny, Dove, and Dusty were apt to
steal off for a swim, although Mr. Lapham had no idea of it. He thought
they sat quietly at home and that Johnny read the Bible out loud to them.
So Sunday was out. But if he got up at three or four Monday morning,
he would have time to clean his work before he took it over to Mr. Hancock
at seven.
After Saturday dinner, Mr. Lapham as usual prepared for a snooze,
stretched out in the one armchair in the shop, with his basket over his head
to keep off the flies. Perhaps Johnny's tyranny during the week had irritated
the old gentleman—who never believed it made the least difference to
anyone when anything was finished.
'Dove, Dusty,' Johnny was yelling, 'build up the furnace, fetch in
charcoal. Hi! you lazy, good-for-nothing dish-mops.'
Dove ran out to the coal house. There was a queer, pleased look on his
face when he returned.
'Charcoal all gone, Master Johnny.'
'Gone!'
'Yep. I haven't said anything because you always like to take charge of
things like that 'round here.'
'Get a basket! Quick! Run to Mr. Hamblin over on Long Wharf. Try
Mrs. Hitchbourn down on Hitchbourn's Wharf. You've got to get charcoal.
Hurry!'
Dove did not hurry. It was getting on toward sunset when at last he
came back, pushing his big basket on a wheelbarrow.
It was the worst-looking charcoal Johnny had ever seen.
'This isn't what we silversmiths use. This is fourth-rate stuff—fit for
iron—maybe. You know that, Dove.'
'Naw. Not me. I don't know anything—see? You're always telling me.'
'I want willow charcoal.'
'You never said so.'
'I'll go myself, but this delay means we'll be working in lamplight and
up to midnight. You are the stupidest animal God ever made—if He made
you, which I doubt. Why your mother didn't drown you when you were a
pup, I can't imagine. Come Lord's day and I have a spare moment, I'm
going to give you such a hiding for your infernal low-down skulking tricks,
you'll be...'
The basket over Mr. Lapham's head moved. He laid it down.
'Boys,' he said mildly, 'you quarrel all the time.'
Johnny, in angry mouthfuls, told him what he thought about Dove and
the charcoal, and threw in a cutting remark about Dusty.
The old master said, 'Dove, I want to speak to Johnny alone.' And then,
'Johnny, I don't want you to be always riding them boys so hard. Dove tries,
but he's stupid. Ain't his fault, is it? If God had wanted him bright He would
have made him that way. We're all poor worms. You're getting above
yourself—like I tried to point out to you. God is going to send you a dire
punishment for your pride.'
'Yes, sir.'
'One trouble with you is you haven't been up against any boys as good
as yourself—or better, maybe. Because you're the best young one in this
shop—or on Hancock's Wharf—you think you're the best one in the world.'
Johnny was so anxious to be on with the work—tediously delayed by
Dove's tricks—he hardly listened.
'And, boy, don't you go get all fretted up over what's after all nothing
but an order for silver. It's sinful to let yourself go so over mundane things.
Now I want you to set quietly and memorize them verses I had you read
about pride. Work's over for the day.'
'What?'
'Yep. It always was the old-fashioned way to start Lord's Day at sunset
on Saturday and I've decided to re-establish the habit in my house.'
'Mr. Lapham, we've got to work this evening. We've promised Mr.
Hancock.'
'I doubt God cares even a little bit whether Mr. Hancock has any silver.
It's better to break faith with him, isn't it, than with the Lord?'
Johnny was tired. His head was ringing. His hands shook a little. He
walked out of the shop, slamming the door after him, and stormed into the
kitchen. He knew Mrs. Lapham did not take much stock in her father-inlaw's pious ways. She and all four girls were in the kitchen. Madge was
frying corn meal, Dorcas wringing out a cheesecloth. Cilla was setting the
table, and Isannah playing with the cat.
Mrs. Lapham looked at him. 'Boy, have you seen a ghost?'
Johnny sat and told his story. He was beyond his customary abusive
eloquence.
The girls stared at him with piteous open mouths. Mrs. Lapham's jaw
set grimly.
'Dorcas, shut that door. Don't let your grandpa hear. Johnny—how many
more work-hours will you need?'
'Seven—maybe. I can get two Monday morning.'
'You shall have them. Sabbath or no Sabbath, that sugar basin is going
to be done on time. I'm not letting any old-fashioned, fussy notions upset
the best order we've had for ten years. And if Mr. Hancock is pleased, he
may come again and again. I can't have my poor, fatherless girls starve just
to please Grandpa. Listen now to me.'
Sunday afternoon Mr. Lapham was not only going to the second
service, as usual, but there was to be a meeting of the deacons, a cold
supper afterward, and a prayer service at the pastor's. 'That's where you get
them five hours, Johnny—tomorrow afternoon.'
Johnny knew that working on the Sabbath was against the law as well
as against all his religious training. He might very well go to the stocks or
to Hell for it, but when Mrs. Lapham said, 'Darest to, Johnny?' he said, 'I
darest.'
'Not a word to the old gentleman, mind.'
'Not a word.'
'Girls, if you so much as peep...'
'Oh, no, Ma.'
Dove and Dusty were to be bribed into service by the promise of
delivering the basin to Mr. Hancock when done. He always gave money to
boys who brought things to the house.
Mrs. Lapham was breathing hard, but she had the matter well in hand. It
was settled.
'Isannah,' she said quietly, 'you call Grandpa and the boys in to supper.
Cilla, run down cellar and fetch cold ale.'
Her mouth and the folds about it, even her nose and eyes, were like
iron.
3
Sunday afternoon and the work went forward with never a hitch. Even
Dove and Dusty were good and obedient, although Dove was halfthreatening to tell 'old Grandpa' when he got home. Johnny did not care
what his master might say—only, please God, the basin were done and Mr.
Hancock come again and again with his rich orders. If Mr. Lapham was
angry, he could sell Johnny's time to Paul Revere.
The four girls, still dressed in their pretty go-to meeting frocks, watched
him with fascinated, admiring eyes. Their mother sent them out-of-doors.
Did the smoke from the furnace show from the wharf? From Fish Street?
Did they hear any comments?
Having found for himself the proper willow charcoal, Johnny went
quickly ahead with his casting. He set his two wax models in wet sand. The
furnace was piping hot. His hands were very sure. He was confident he
could do the work, yet inside he was keyed up and jumpy.
Mrs. Lapham fussed about him and he ordered her to do simple things.
'Not the draft yet, Mrs. Lapham ... now get to work with the bellows.'
Once he even told her to 'look sharp,' and she took it with a humble
'Yes, Johnny.'
'Now fetch me the crucible.'
She turned to Dove. 'Which one does he want, boy?'
'I'll get her down.'
Dove went to the shelves where the crucibles for melting silver were
kept. Johnny did not see Dove standing on a stool, reaching far back and
carefully taking out a cracked crucible. Dusty saw him and giggled. He
knew the crack in it was so small it was hard even to see. It might stand the
heat of the furnace, but the chances were that it would not. That was why
Mr. Lapham had put it so far back. Both he and Dove thought it would just
about serve Johnny Tremain right—after the insufferable way he had been
bossing everybody—if the crucible gave way and the hot silver did spill all
over the top of the furnace. It would certainly make Johnny look like a fool,
after all his fussing.
Johnny took the cracked crucible in his trusting hands, put in it silver
ingots, set it on top of the furnace.
Cilla flew in. 'Ma, there's a man looking at our chimney.'
'How's he dressed?'
'Seafaring man.'
'No seafaring man ever objected to a little Sabbath-breaking. But mind
if you see any deacons or constables.'
The work went on.
Isannah sat with the cat in her lap. 'Johnny's going to Hell,' she said
firmly. Johnny himself thought this was possible.
He called to Mrs. Lapham to 'look sharp' and put the old silver turnip
watch where he could see it. The silver must be run at a certain speed and
be allowed to cool for just so long.
Mrs. Lapham was so slavishly eager to help him, he almost felt fond of
her. He did not notice Dusty and Dove snickering in a corner.
Some of the beeswax he had used for his models had been left too near
the furnace. It had melted and run over the floor. Johnny had been taught to
clean up as he went along, but today he was in too much of a hurry to
bother.
'Johnny,' cried Mrs. Lapham, 'isn't it time to pour? Look, the silver is
melted and begun to wink.' It was true.
He moved forward delicately, his right hand outstretched. The crucible
began to settle—collapse, the silver was running over the top of the furnace
like spilled milk. Johnny jumped toward it, his right hand still outstretched.
Something happened, he never knew exactly what. His feet went out from
under him. His hand came down on the top of the furnace.
The burn was so terrible he at first felt no pain, but stood stupidly
looking at his hand. For one second, before the metal cooled, the inside of
his right hand, from wrist to fingertips, was coated with solid silver. He
looked at the back of his hand. It was as always. Then he smelled burned
flesh. The room blackened and tipped around him. He heard a roaring in his
ears.
When he came to, he was stretched out upon the floor. Dorcas was
trying to pour brandy down his throat. Mrs. Lapham had plunged the
burned hand into a panful of flour and was yelling at Madge to hurry with
her bread poultice.
He saw Cilla's face. It was literally green. 'Ma,' she said, licking her
white lips, 'shall I run for Doctor Warren?'
'No—no ... oh, wait, I've got to think. I don't want any of them doctors
to know we was breaking Sabbath Day. And we don't need no doctor for
just a burn. Cilla, you run down the wharf and you fetch that old midwife,
Gran' Hopper. These old women know better than any doctor how to cure
things like this. Johnny, how you feel?'
'All right.'
'Hurt yet?'
'Not yet.'
He knew it would later.
4
Johnny lay in the 'birth and death room.' This was hardly more than a closet
with a tiny window off the kitchen, used for storage except in times of
sickness. His hand had been done up in a linseed poultice. The smell of the
linseed was stifling, and now, on the second day, the pain had really begun.
His arm throbbed to the shoulder. Gran' Hopper was in the kitchen, talking
to Mrs. Lapham.
'Mind you keep that poultice wet. Just leave it wrapped up and wet it
now and then with lime water. There's more luck than anything else in
things like this is. If it don't come along good, I'll make a charm.'
Not many years before, Gran' Hopper would have been hanged for a
witch. She had the traditional venerable years, the toothless cackle, the
mustache. Nor was she above resorting to charms. But she had had vast
experience. No doctor in Boston knew more than she about midwifery and
children's diseases. So far she had done as well as any of them, except for
one thing. The hand had been allowed to draw together—turn in on itself. It
was less painful than if it had been held out flat.
By the fourth day ulceration had set in. This was considered Nature's
way of healing an injury. Gran' Hopper gave him laudanum and more
laudanum. There followed drowsy days and nights that ran together, a
ceaseless roaring in the ears. There was nothing left of him but the pain and
the drug.
The fever abated and with it the doses of the drug. Johnny had not once
looked at his hand since he had stood before the furnace and seen it lined
with silver. Gran' Hopper said on the next day she would unwrap it and see,
as she cheerfully put it, 'what was left.'
Thus far the pain and the drug and the fever had dulled his mind. He
had not thought about the future, for of what use to anyone was a cripplehanded silversmith? But that night Gran' Hopper's words haunted him. Next
day she would see 'what was left.'
He was utterly unprepared for the sight of his hand when finally it was
unwrapped and lay in the midwife's aproned lap. Mrs. Lapham, Madge,
Dorcas, all had crowded into the little birth and death room. Cilla and
Isannah were in the kitchen, too frightened to go near him.
'My!' said Madge, 'isn't that funny-looking? The top part, Johnny, looks
all right, although a little narrow, but, Johnny, your thumb and palm have
grown together.'
This was true. He bent and twisted his fingers. He could not get the
thumb to meet the forefinger. Such a hand was completely useless. For the
first time he faced the fact that his hand was crippled.
'Oh, let me see!' Dorcas was leaning over him. She gave her most
elegant little screech of horror, just like a great lady who has seen a mouse.
'My!' said Mrs. Lapham, 'that's worse than anything I had imagined.
Now isn't that a shame! Bright boy like Johnny just ruined. No more good
than a horse with sprung knees.'
Johnny did not stay to hear more. That morning he had dressed (with
Mrs. Lapham's competent help) for the first time. He got up, stood facing
them stiffly, his bad hand jammed into his breeches pocket.
'I'm going out,' he said thickly.
Cilla and Isannah sat close together in a frightened huddle, staring at
him, not daring to speak. He said rudely, 'You should have come in too—
and seen the fun.'
Cilla gaped at him, tried to say something, but only swallowed.
'You two—sitting there—looking like a couple of fishes.'
He slammed the front door after him. He had always been bad about
slamming doors. In the fresh air he felt better. He pretended not to hear Mrs.
Lapham calling him from a window to come right back. All Fish Street
could hear when Mrs. Lapham called. He paid no heed.
He walked all over Boston, his hand thrust deep in his breeches pocket.
Instinctively he wanted to tire himself out (which was easy in his weakened
condition) so he could not think.
When he came back, there was something queer about the silence of the
kitchen. No one reproved him because he had disobeyed Mrs. Lapham. He
knew they had been talking about him.
Cilla, for one of the first times in her life, tried to be polite to him.
'Oh, Johnny,' she whispered, 'I'm sorrier than I was ever sorry before.'
Isannah said, 'Is it true, like Ma says, you'll be only good for picking
rags?'
Cilla turned on Isannah. 'You're crazy! Johnny isn't going to pick rags ...
But oh, Johnny, it's so awful and I'm so sorry and...'
Johnny's face was crimson. 'Will you stop talking about it!'
Isannah went on—' Madge says it looks awful...'
'If either of you girls,' he stormed, 'ever mention that I've even got a
hand, I'll ... I'll ... just get on a ship and never come back. I'm not going to
have you mucking about with your infernal cry-baby "Oh how dreadfuls." '
So he went to the shop.
He saw with anger that Dove was sitting at his bench, daring to use his
tools. He had not been in the shop for a month. Of course it should be
expected that Dove would use his bench—for a little while—just until he
was back at it himself.
Mr. Lapham had looked up from his work, blinked gently, shook his
head and sighed. Dusty was making a terrific din in one corner.
Johnny stood and watched Dove's clumsy work as long as he could in
silence. At last he burst out.
'Dove, don't hold your crimping iron like that...'
Dove leaned back. His fat, white face grinned up at him with
exaggerated innocence.
'Thank you, Master Johnny. I know I'm not as good as you are. Won't
you please to show me just how I should hold my crimping iron?'
Johnny walked out of the shop by the door leading to the wharf. He'd
never show anybody again how to hold a crimping iron. If you can't do, you
had best shut up. He started to slam the door, thought better of it. If you
can't do, you'd best not slam doors.
So he strolled the length of the wharf. There was a big ship in from
Jamaica. He idly watched porters rolling barrels of molasses out of its hold.
A sailor was trying to sell an old lady a parrot. He saw John Hancock
standing in a group of men. The sugar basin had never been delivered.
When Mr. Lapham had discovered the evil that had gone on in his absence
and the terrible punishment God had meted out to Johnny Tremain, he had
ordered the whole thing melted down and he himself had gone over to Mr.
Hancock, returned the cream pitcher, and merely said he had found it
impossible to make a sugar basin. No explanation.
The boy was accustomed to working from eight to twelve, sometimes
fourteen hours in a day. He had no holidays, no Saturday afternoons. He
had often imagined to himself the pleasure it would be just to stroll once
down Hancock's Wharf, as he was strolling now. Nothing to do. His hands
in his pockets. Other boys—friends of his—would look up from their work,
envy his idleness. Here and there he did see a familiar face. He believed
every one of them was talking about his burn—pitying him. There was not
a boy on the wharf Johnny did not know. He had made friends with some
and enemies of others, and had played or fought with all of them. He saw
Saul and Dicer packing salt herrings in a tub; Andy, his leather thimble
strapped to his palm, sewing a sail; Tom Drinker (the local bully) coopering
a barrel. This was Johnny's world, but now he walked through it an alien.
They knew what had happened. They did not envy Johnny's idleness. He
saw one nudge another. They were whispering about him—daring to pity
him. Dicer's master, the herring-pickler, yelled some kind remark to him,
but Johnny did not answer. Seemingly in one month he had become a
stranger, an outcast on Hancock's Wharf. He was maimed and they were
whole.
At the end of the wharf, under the derrick used for unloading the
largaest ships, he stripped off his clothes and dove into the water. There was
not another working boy in Boston who was out swimming in the middle of
the afternoon. Only once or twice in a summer—on days of unendurable
heat, teachers dismissed school, masters closed shops, and the boys ran
down to the wharves to swim. Sometimes, like Mr. Lapham's boys, they
swam secretly, silently, on Sunday afternoons, but usually only after dusk
had fallen and the day's work was over.
Johnny dove and swam. But it was curious to be alone. He did not like
the feeling of being thus cut off from his normal life.
Yet one thing gave him great pleasure. Once in the water, his bad hand
was as good as the other. Swimming, he could forget it.

At first Mrs. Lapham tended to humor the 'poor boy.' As he preferred the
birth and death room to the attic with Dove and Dusty, she had let him stay
on. He had never in all his life slept in a bed alone—much less a whole
room. He wanted to be alone.
There was one trouble with his new quarters. When Mrs. Lapham came
down to start breakfast, she always began by getting him up.
'Get into your clothes—you lazy boy. Stop by at Deacon Parson's for a
quart of milk. Get to the town pump.'
Soon enough she was addressing him as a 'lazy good-for-nothing,' a
'lug-a-bed,' a 'worthless limb of Satan.' Such words poured out of her
absent-mindedly, but never in the old days had she called Johnny such
names.
The boy least necessary in the shop had always done chores. Now both
Dove and Dusty were more valuable than Johnny Tremain. Every morning
he put on the heavy wooden yoke, trudged over to North Square for
drinking water. Now for the first time he learned to handle a broom
properly. He carried in charcoal for the annealing furnace in the shop and
wood for the cooking hearth in the kitchen, and as he moved restlessly
about doing (and often failing to do) this humble work, Cilla and Isannah
watched him and said little. Never a single insult. He had made it clear to
them he wanted to be left alone.
Madge and Dorcas found innumerable small tasks for him, now he
'wasn't doing anything.' Once fat Madge made him sit before her, holding a
skein of yarn from which she wound a ball. He was miserable with his
crippled hand stretched out for all the world to see. When she mentioned it,
he threw the yarn at her head and walked off.
One day Mr. Lapham called to him and led him to a bench under the old
willow behind the coal house. The old man had never once berated him for
Sabbath-breaking, never reminded him how often he had pointed out that
pride goeth before a fall.
'My boy,' he said mildly, 'soon it will be September. Summer is over.'
Johnny nodded. 'And I feel I must talk with you. When I signed for you,
Johnny, there was a mutual contract between your mother and myself. She's
dead, so the contract is now between you and me. I promised to feed and
clothe you, keep you in good discipline, and as far as your capacity
permitted to teach you the silversmith's arts and mysteries.... I ... I never had
a boy so quick to teach, but ... And you promised to serve me diligently for
seven years, to keep my secrets and my honor. You've done all that, Johnny.
But ... but now ... I can't keep my contract with you. I can't teach a cripplehanded boy to be a silversmith.'
Johnny said nothing.
'Mrs. L. is right,' the old man went on.
'You mean she wants you to get rid of me?'
'Not exactly, but she does think it is an extravagance for a poor
household to keep a boy just for chores. But I've told her'—there was an
unexpected glint of determination in the groping old eyes—'I've told her as
long as you wish you are to stay with us. I won't ever ... turn you out. I
mind the time your mother came to my shop with you ... she was a sweet
lady ... very genteel. She said your heart was fastened on being a
silversmith. She said you was a bright boy—you always was that. Now,
Johnny, it's for your own good I'm talking to you. You've got to learn
another way of supporting yourself. I want you to go around, look about the
shops, and find out a respectable trade where a bad hand won't matter too
much. You're a bright boy, Johnny. Maybe a ropemaker or a cooper or a
weaver could teach you his craft. That hand of yours will soon be strong
enough, but will always be sort of doubled in on itself.'
Johnny started to look at his hand, but quickly thrust it back in his
pocket.
'You're right,' he said. 'I've got to go.'
'I don't want you to feel hurried about leaving us, Johnny. You're just
about earning your keep by the odd jobs you do, spite of what Mrs. L. says.
You look about you quietly and find a trade to your fancy and a master you
think you'd like. You can tell him from me I'll give the rest of your time
away for nothing.'
It was less than two months ago Mr. Revere was promising something
extra for his time.
'Mrs. L. doesn't like it the way you loiter off and go swimming; but you
loiter and swim all you have a mind—just so you get the chores done and
settle down real hard to finding yourself a new trade. And one more thing I
have on my mind.'
'Yes, sir.'
'I want you to forgive Dove like a Christian.'
'Forgive him? Why?'
'Why, that when you asked for a crucible he handed you the old cracked
one.'
'You mean ... he did it on purpose?'
'No, no, Johnny, he only meant to humiliate you. He tells me (Mrs. L.
made me question him) that he was that offended by your Sabbath-breaking
he thought it fitting that you should learn a lesson. I can't help but admit I'm
encouraged with that much piety in one of my boys.'
Johnny's voice sounded strangled. 'Mr. Lapham, I'm going to get him
for that...'
'Hush, hush, boy. I say, and Bible says, forgive. He was real repentant
when he told me. Never meant to harm you. He was in tears.'
'He's going to be in a lot more of those tears 'fore I'm done with him.
That scabby, white louse, that hypocritical...'
'Hold your tongue, boy. I thought misfortune had taught you patience.'
'It has,' said Johnny. 'If I have to, I'll wait ten years to get that Dove.'
But he quieted himself instantly and thanked his master for his
kindness. As he walked past the shop, he saw Dove and Dusty hanging idly
out of the shop window. They were looking for him.
Dove said: 'Will Mr. Johnny Tremain be so kind as to fetch us drinking
water? Mrs. Lapham says we are too valuable to leave our benches. She told
us we were to send you.'
Without a word he went to the back entry, put on the heavy yoke.
Understandably, the sight ofJohnny wielding a broom, carrying
charcoal, firewood, water, had not quickly lost its fascination for his
erstwhile slaves. They were still hanging out of the window.
'Look sharp, Johnny.'
'Hey, boy, look sharp.'
Giggles. A low whistle.
Johnny said nothing.
