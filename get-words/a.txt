DEEP MAGIC FROM THE
DAWN OF TIME
NOW WE MUST GET BACK TO EDMUND. When he had been made to
walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the
Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew
trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all
and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let
him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was.
The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.
“No,” said the dwarf, “it is no use now, O Queen. They must have
reached the Stone Table by now.”
“Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,” said the Witch.
“It cannot be good news if he does,” said the dwarf.
“Four thrones in Cair Paravel,” said the Witch. “How if only three were
filled? That would not fulfill the prophecy.”
“What difference would that make now that He is here?” said the dwarf.
He did not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.
“He may not stay long. And then—we would fall upon the three at
Cair.”
“Yet it might be better,” said the dwarf, “to keep this one” (here he
kicked Edmund) “for bargaining with.”
“Yes! and have him rescued,” said the Witch scornfully.
“Then,” said the dwarf, “we had better do what we have to do at once.”
“I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself,” said the Witch.
“That is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.”
“It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to
its proper use,” said the dwarf.
“True,” said the Witch; and then, “Well, I will begin.”
At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.
“I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with Him. They have
killed my captain, Maugrim. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One
of the Sons of Adam killed him. Fly! Fly!”
“No,” said the Witch. “There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon
all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can. Call out the giants
and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side. Call
the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres, and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels,
the Hags, the Specters, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight.
What? Have I not still my wand? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as
they come on? Be off quickly, I have a little thing to finish here while you
are away.”
The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.
“Now!” said she, “we have no table—let me see. We had better put it
against the trunk of a tree.”
Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the dwarf
set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch
take off her outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly
white. Because they were so very white he could see them, but he could not
see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.
“Prepare the victim,” said the Witch. And the dwarf undid Edmund’s
collar and folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund’s hair and
pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund
heard a strange noise—whizz—whizz—whizz. For a moment he couldn’t
think what it was. Then he realized. It was the sound of a knife being
sharpened.
At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction—a
drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings—a scream from the Witch—
confusion all round him. And then he found he was being untied. Strong
arms were round him and he heard big, kind voices saying things like—
“Let him lie down—give him some wine—drink this—steady now—
you’ll be all right in a minute.”
Then he heard the voices of people who were not talking to him but to
one another. And they were saying things like “Who’s got the Witch?” “I
thought you had her.” “I didn’t see her after I knocked the knife out of her
hand—I was after the dwarf—do you mean to say she’s escaped?” “—A
chap can’t mind everything at once—what’s that? Oh, sorry, it’s only an old
stump!” But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint.
Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of
course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off
to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they
could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think
they might have been surprised.
It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright; if you had
been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump
and on a fair-sized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would
gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the
stump and the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did
look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground. And if
you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across
to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in
reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the dwarf. For
it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they
aren’t, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when
the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept hold of her wand, so it
had been kept safe, too.
When the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping
on piles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard—from Mrs.
Beaver—was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late
last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had
breakfasted they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund
walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is
no need to tell you (and no one ever heard) what Aslan was saying, but it
was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer
Aslan turned to meet them, bringing Edmund with him.
“Here is your brother,” he said, “and—there is no need to talk to him
about what is past.”
Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in
turn, “I’m sorry,” and everyone said, “That’s all right.” And then everyone
wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that
they were all friends with him again—something ordinary and natural—and
of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before
they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan
and said,
“Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.”
“Let him approach,” said Aslan.
The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch’s dwarf.
“What is your message, Son of Earth?” asked Aslan.
“The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe
conduct to come and speak with you,” said the dwarf, “on a matter which is
as much to your advantage as to hers.”
“Queen of Narnia, indeed!” said Mr. Beaver. “Of all the cheek—”
“Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan. “All names will soon be restored to their
proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about them. Tell your
mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she
leaves her wand behind her at that great oak.”
This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the dwarf to see
that the conditions were properly carried out. “But supposing she turns the
two leopards into stone?” whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea
had occurred to the leopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off
their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling—
like a cat’s when it sees a strange dog.
“It’ll be all right,” whispered Peter in reply. “He wouldn’t send them if
it weren’t.”
A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the
hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children
who had not seen her before felt shudders running down their backs at the
sight of her face; and there were low growls among all the animals present.
Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two
people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the
Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces—the golden
face and the dead-white face—so close together. Not that the Witch looked
Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs. Beaver particularly noticed this.
“You have a traitor there, Aslan,” said the Witch. Of course everyone
present knew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking
about himself after all he’d been through and after the talk he’d had that
morning. He just went on looking at Aslan. It didn’t seem to matter what
the Witch said.
“Well,” said Aslan. “His offense was not against you.”
“Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?” asked the Witch.
“Let us say I have forgotten it,” answered Aslan gravely. “Tell us of this
Deep Magic.”
“Tell you?” said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller. “Tell
you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell
you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the fire-stones on
the Secret Hill? Tell you what is engraved on the scepter of the Emperorbeyond-the-Sea? You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into
Narnia at the very beginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as
my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill.”
“Oh,” said Mr. Beaver. “So that’s how you came to imagine yourself a
queen—because you were the Emperor’s hangman. I see.”
“Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan, with a very low growl.
“And so,” continued the Witch, “that human creature is mine. His life is
forfeit to me. His blood is my property.”
“Come and take it then,” said the Bull with the man’s head in a great
bellowing voice.
“Fool,” said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, “do
you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force? He
knows the Deep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood
as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.”
“It is very true,” said Aslan, “I do not deny it.”
“Oh, Aslan!” whispered Susan in the Lion’s ear, “can’t we—I mean,
you won’t, will you? Can’t we do something about the Deep Magic? Isn’t
there something you can work against it?”
“Work against the Emperor’s Magic?” said Aslan, turning to her with
something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion
to him again.
Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan’s
face. He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something;
but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to
wait, and do what he was told.
“Fall back, all of you,” said Aslan, “and I will talk to the Witch alone.”
They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this—waiting and wondering
while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy
said, “Oh, Edmund!” and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the
others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other’s
paws with their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their
hoofs. But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed
even small sounds like a bumble-bee flying past, or the birds in the forest
down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between
Aslan and the White Witch went on.
At last they heard Aslan’s voice, “You can all come back,” he said. “I
have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother’s
blood.” And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been
holding their breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur
of talk.
The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face
when she stopped and said,
“But how do I know this promise will be kept?”
“Haa-a-arrh!” roared Aslan, half rising from his throne; and his great
mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the
Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her
skirts and fairly ran for her life.
Fourteen
THE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCH
AS SOON AS THE WITCH HAD GONE ASLAN said, “We must move
from this place at once, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall
encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna.”
Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters
with the witch; but his face was stern and everyone’s ears were still ringing
with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared.
After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun
had got strong by now and dried the grass), they were busy for a while
taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o’clock they
were on the march and set off in a northeasterly direction, walking at an
easy pace for they had not far to go.
During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of
campaign. “As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,” he said,
“the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and
prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent
her from reaching it.” He then went on to outline two plans of battle—one
for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting
her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the
operations, saying things like, “You must put your Centaurs in such and
such a place” or “You must post scouts to see that she doesn’t do so-andso,” till at last Peter said,
“But you will be there yourself, Aslan.”
“I can give you no promise of that,” answered the Lion. And he
continued giving Peter his instructions.
For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of
him. He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.
It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river
valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the
Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water. But
Peter said,
“Wouldn’t it be better to camp on the far side—for fear she should try a
night attack or anything?”
Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, roused
himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said, “Eh? What’s that?”
Peter said it all over again.
“No,” said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn’t matter. “No. She will not
make an attack tonight.” And then he sighed deeply. But presently he
added, “All the same it was well thought of. That is how a soldier ought to
think. But it doesn’t really matter.” So they proceeded to pitch their camp.
Aslan’s mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling
uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news
that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that
evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night
or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were
already drawing to their end.
This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn’t get to sleep when
she went to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and
over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the
darkness.
“Can’t you get to sleep either?” said Susan:
“No,” said Lucy. “I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!”
“What?”
“I’ve a most horrible feeling—as if something were hanging over us.”
“Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.”
“Something about Aslan,” said Lucy. “Either some dreadful thing is
going to happen to him, or something dreadful that he’s going to do.”
“There’s been something wrong with him all afternoon,” said Susan.
“Lucy! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle? You
don’t think he could be stealing away and leaving us tonight, do you?”
“Where is he now?” said Lucy. “Is he here in the pavilion?”
“I don’t think so.”
“Susan! let’s go outside and have a look round. We might see him.”
“All right. Let’s,” said Susan; “we might just as well be doing that as
lying awake here.”
Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers
and crept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was
quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then
Susan suddenly caught Lucy’s arm and said, “Look!” On the far side of the
camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly
walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followed
him.
He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly
to the right—apparently by the very same route which they had used that
afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led
them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet
with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different from the Aslan they
knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were
very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where
there were no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It
was no good trying to run away so they came toward him. When they were
closer he said,
“Oh, children, children, why are you following me?”
“We couldn’t sleep,” said Lucy—and then felt sure that she need say no
more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.
“Please, may we come with you—wherever you’re going?” asked
Susan.
“Well—” said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, “I should
be glad of company tonight. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop
when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.”
“Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,” said the two girls.
Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the
Lion. But how slowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that
his nose nearly touched the grass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low
moan.
“Aslan! Dear Aslan!” said Lucy, “what is wrong? Can’t you tell us?”
“Are you ill, dear Aslan?” asked Susan.
“No,” said Aslan. “I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so
that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that.”
And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his
permission, but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him—
buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so
doing, walked with him. And presently they saw that they were going with
him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up
at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got to the last
tree (it was one that had some bushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,
“Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do
not let yourselves be seen. Farewell.”
And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and
clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his
great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out on to the top of
the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him and
this is what they saw.
A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and
though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned
with evil-looking red flames and black smoke. But such people! Ogres with
monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men; spirits of evil trees and
poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won’t describe because if I
did the grown-ups would probably not let you read this book—Cruels and
Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses,
and Ettins. In fact here were all those who were on the Witch’s side and
whom the Wolf had summoned at her command. And right in the middle,
standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.
A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they
first saw the great Lion pacing toward them, and for a moment even the
Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and
gave a wild, fierce laugh.
“The fool!” she cried. “The fool has come. Bind him fast.”
Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan’s roar and his
spring upon his enemies. But it never came. Four Hags, grinning and
leering, yet also (at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to
do, had approached him. “Bind him, I say!” repeated the White Witch. The
Hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he
made no resistance at all. Then others—evil dwarfs and apes—rushed in to
help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on his back
and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had
done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws
could have been the death of them all. But he made no noise, even when the
enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut into
his flesh. Then they began to drag him toward the Stone Table.
“Stop!” said the Witch. “Let him first be shaved.”
Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre
with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan’s head.
Snip-snip-snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to
the ground. Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their
hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different
without its mane. The enemies also saw the difference.
“Why, he’s only a great cat after all!” cried one.
“Is that what we were afraid of?” said another.
And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him, saying things like “Puss,
Puss! Poor Pussy,” and “How many mice have you caught today, Cat?” and
“Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?”
“Oh, how can they?” said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. “The
brutes, the brutes!” for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of
Aslan looked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.
“Muzzle him!” said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his
face putting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or
three of them their hands. But he never moved. And this seemed to enrage
all that rabble. Everyone was at him now. Those who had been afraid to
come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for
a few minutes the two girls could not even see him—so thickly was he
surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him,
spitting on him, jeering at him.
At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound
and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He
was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to
hoist him onto the surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening
of cords.
“The cowards! The cowards!” sobbed Susan. “Are they still afraid of
him, even now?”
When once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass of
cords) on the flat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four
torches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch bared her arms as she
had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of
Aslan. Then she began to whet her knife. It looked to the children, when the
gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone, not of
steel, and it was of a strange and evil shape.
At last she drew near. She stood by Aslan’s head. Her face was working
and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither
angry nor afraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she
stooped down and said in a quivering voice,
“And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would
save the human traitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was
and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will
prevent me from killing him as well? And who will take him out of my
hand then? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you have
lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that knowledge, despair
and die.”
The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn’t
bear to look and had covered their eyes.
Fifteen
DEEPER MAGIC FROM
BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME
WHILE THE TWO GIRLS STILL CROUCHED in the bushes with their
hands over their faces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out,
“Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It
will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that
the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.”
At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great
danger. For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns
blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hilltop and
down the slope right past their hiding-place. They felt the Specters go by
them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under
the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and overhead there went a flurry of foul
wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other time they
would have trembled with fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror
of Aslan’s death so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it.
As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto the
open hilltop. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across
her, but still they could see the shape of the Lion lying dead in his bonds.
And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and
stroked his beautiful fur—what was left of it—and cried till they could cry
no more. And then they looked at each other and held each, other’s hands
for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy
said,
“I can’t bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take it
off?”
So they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold
and it was now the darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when
they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and
fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could.
And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to
describe.
“I wonder could we untie him as well?” said Susan presently. But the
enemies, out of pure spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girls
could make nothing of the knots.
I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan
and Lucy were that night; but if you have been—if you’ve been up all night
and cried till you have no more tears left in you—you will know that there
comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going
to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and
hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they
were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy noticed two other things.
One was that the sky on the east side of the hill was a little less dark than it
had been an hour ago. The other was some tiny movement going on in the
grass at her feet. At first she took no interest in this. What did it matter?
Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw that whatever-it-was had begun
to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And now whatever-theywere were moving about on Aslan’s body. She peered closer. They were
little gray things.
“Ugh!” said Susan from the other side of the Table. “How beastly!
There are horrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.”
And she raised her hand to frighten them away.
“Wait!” said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still.
“Can you see what they’re doing?”
Both girls bent down and stared.
“I do believe—” said Susan. “But how queer! They’re nibbling away at
the cords!”
“That’s what I thought,” said Lucy. “I think they’re friendly mice. Poor
little things—they don’t realize he’s dead. They think it’ll do some good
untying him.”
It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the
first time the white face of the other. They could see the mice nibbling
away; dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice. And at last,
one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.
The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting
fainter—all except one very big one low down on the eastern horizon. They
felt colder than they had been all night. The mice crept away again.
The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked
more like himself without them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler,
as the light grew and they could see it better.
In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so
still for hours and hours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it.
Soon there were birds singing all over the place.
It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.
“I’m so cold,” said Lucy.
“So am I,” said Susan. “Let’s walk about a bit.”
They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one
big star had almost disappeared. The country all looked dark gray, but
beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea showed pale. The sky began to
turn red. They walked to and fro more times than they could count between
the dead Aslan and the eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how
tired their legs felt. Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out
toward the sea and Cair Paravel (which they could now just make out) the
red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very
slowly up came the edge of the sun. At that moment they heard from behind
them a loud noise—a great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had
broken a giant’s plate.
“What’s that?” said Lucy, clutching Susan’s arm.
“I—I feel afraid to turn round,” said Susan; “something awful is
happening.”
“They’re doing something worse to Him,” said Lucy. “Come on!” And
she turned, pulling Susan round with her.
The rising of the sun had made everything look so different—all colors
and shadows were changed—that for a moment they didn’t see the
important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces
by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.
“Oh, oh, oh!” cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.
“Oh, it’s too bad,” sobbed Lucy; “they might have left the body alone.”
“Who’s done it?” cried Susan. “What does it mean? Is it more magic?”
“Yes!” said a great voice behind their backs. “It is more magic.” They
looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him
before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan
himself.
“Oh, Aslan!” cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much
frightened as they were glad.
“Aren’t you dead then, dear Aslan?” said Lucy.
“Not now,” said Aslan.
“You’re not—not a—?” asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn’t
bring herself to say the word ghost. Aslan stooped his golden head and
licked her forehead. The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that
seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.
“Do I look it?” he said.
“Oh, you’re real, you’re real! Oh, Aslan!” cried Lucy, and both girls
flung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses.
“But what does it all mean?” asked Susan when they were somewhat
calmer.
“It means,” said Aslan, “that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic,
there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes
back only to the dawn of time. But if she could have looked a little further
back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would
have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a
willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor’s
stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working
backward. And now—”
“Oh yes. Now?” said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her hands.
“Oh, children,” said the Lion, “I feel my strength coming back to me.
Oh, children, catch me if you can!” He stood for a second, his eyes very
bright, his limbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail. Then he made a
leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table.
Laughing, though she didn’t know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach
him. Aslan leaped again. A mad chase began. Round and round the hilltop
he led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost
catch his tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with
his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now
stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a
happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such a romp as no one
has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with a
thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind.
And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in
the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.
“And now,” said Aslan presently, “to business. I feel I am going to roar.
You had better put your fingers in your ears.”
And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to
roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they
saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass
bends in a meadow before the wind. Then he said.
“We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.” And he crouched
down and the children climbed onto his warm, golden back, and Susan sat
first, holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly
to Susan. And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off,
faster than any horse could go, down hill and into the thick of the forest.
That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them
in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then
take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the bits and
imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then
imagine instead of the black or gray or chestnut back of the horse the soft
roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then
imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this
is a mount that doesn’t need to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes
on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way
with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the
smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you
are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right
across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny
glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past
roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes
alight with gorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains
and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and
out into acres of blue flowers.
It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steep
hillside at a castle—a little toy castle it looked from where they stood—
which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at
such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time
even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it.
And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of
them. No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And
Aslan, not at all slacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet toward it.
“The Witch’s home!” he cried. “Now, children, hold tight.”
Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the
children felt as if they had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had
gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and
jumped—or you may call it flying rather than jumping—right over the
castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling
off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.
Sixteen
WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT THE
STATUES
“WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE!” cried Lucy. “All those stone
animals—and people too! It’s—it’s like a museum.”
“Hush,” said Susan, “Aslan’s doing something.”
He was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on
him. Then without waiting a moment he whisked round—almost as if he
had been a cat chasing its tail—and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which
(as you remember) was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it.
Then he pounced on a tall stone dryad which stood beyond the dwarf,
turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to
two centaurs. But at that moment Lucy said,
“Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.”
I expect you’ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper
which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second
nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny streak of flame
creeping along the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second
after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same. Then
a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back—then it
spread—then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all
over a bit of paper—then, while his hindquarters were still obviously stone,
the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds rippled into living
hair. Then he opened a great red mouth, warm and living, and gave a
prodigious yawn. And now his hind legs had come to life. He lifted one of
them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he went
bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and
jumping up to lick his face.
Of course the children’s eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight
they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the
statues were coming to life. The courtyard looked no longer like a museum;
it looked more like a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing
round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly
white the courtyard was now a blaze of colors; glossy chestnut sides of
centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy-brown
of foxes, dogs and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs;
and the birch-girls in silver, and the beech-girls in fresh, transparent green,
and the larch-girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow. And instead
of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings,
brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings,
shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.
“Oh!” said Susan in a different tone. “Look! I wonder—I mean, is it
safe?”
Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the
stone giant.
“It’s all right!” shouted Aslan joyously. “Once the feet are put right, all
the rest of him will follow.”
“That wasn’t exactly what I meant,” whispered Susan to Lucy. But it
was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened
to her. The change was already creeping up the Giant’s legs. Now he was
moving his feet. A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder, rubbed
his eyes and said,
“Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where’s that dratted little
Witch that was running about on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it
was.” But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really
happened, and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to
repeat it all again so that at last he understood, then he bowed down till his
head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap
repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his honest ugly face. (Giants of any
sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good-tempered that
ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming. It’s a sight
well worth looking at.)
“Now for the inside of this house!” said Aslan. “Look alive, everyone.
Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady’s chamber! Leave no corner
unsearched. You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.”
And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole
of that dark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows
and with everyone’s voices crying out at once, “Don’t forget the dungeons
—Give us a hand with this door!—Here’s another little winding stair—Oh!
I say. Here’s a poor kangaroo. Call Aslan—Phew! How it smells in here—
Look out for trap-doors—Up here! There are a whole lot more on the
landing!” But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting
out,
“Aslan! Aslan! I’ve found Mr. Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.”
A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding each other by
both hands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none
the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all
she had to tell him.
But at last the ransacking of the Witch’s fortress was ended. The whole
castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the
sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil places which needed
them so badly. The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the
courtyard. And it was then that someone (Tumnus, I think) first said,
“But how are we going to get out?” for Aslan had got in by a jump and
the gates were still locked.
“That’ll be all right,” said Aslan; and then, rising on his hind-legs, he
bawled up at the Giant. “Hi! You up there,” he roared. “What’s your
name?”
“Giant Rumblebuffin, if it please your honor,” said the Giant, once more
touching his cap.
“Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,” said Aslan, “just let us out of this,
will you?”
“Certainly, your honor. It will be a pleasure,” said Giant Rumblebuffin.
“Stand well away from the gates, all you little “uns.” Then he strode to the
gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club. The gates
creaked at the first blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third.
Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of
crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each
side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble; and when the dust
cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the
gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and
the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky.
“Blowed if I ain’t all in a muck sweat,” said the Giant, puffing like the
largest railway engine. “Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither
of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket-handkerchee about you?”
“Yes, I have,” said Lucy, standing on tip-toes and holding her
handkerchief up as far as she could reach.
“Thank you, Missie,” said Giant Rumblebuffin, stooping down. Next
moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid-air
between the Giant’s finger and thumb. But just as she was getting near his
face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground
muttering, “Bless me! I’ve picked up the little girl instead. I beg your
pardon, Missie, I thought you was the handkerchee!”
“No, no,” said Lucy laughing, “here it is!” This time he managed to get
it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would
be to you, so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across
his great red face, she said, “I’m afraid it’s not much use to you, Mr.
Rumblebuffin.”
“Not at all. Not at all,” said the giant politely. “Never met a nicer
handkerchee. So fine, so handy. So—I don’t know how to describe it.”
“What a nice giant he is!” said Lucy to Mr. Tumnus.
“Oh yes,” replied the Faun. “All the Buffins always were. One of the
most respected of all the giant families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps
(I never knew a giant that was), but an old family. With traditions, you
know. If he’d been the other sort she’d never have turned him into stone.”
At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.
“Our day’s work is not yet over,” he said, “and if the Witch is to be
finally defeated before bedtime we must find the battle at once.”
“And join in, I hope, sir!” added the largest of the Centaurs.
“Of course,” said Aslan. “And now! Those who can’t keep up—that is,
children, dwarfs, and small animals—must ride on the backs of those who
can—that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who
are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out
where the battle is. Look lively and sort yourselves.”
And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased
of the lot was the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending
to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met, “Did you hear
what he said? Us Lions. That means him and me. Us Lions. That’s what I
like about Aslan. No side, no stand-offishness. Us Lions. That meant him
and me.” At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with
three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a
bit.
When all were ready (it was a big sheepdog who actually helped Aslan
most in getting them sorted into their proper order) they set out through the
gap in the castle wall. At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all
directions. But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave
a bay. There was no time lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and
wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses
to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half a mile behind
them, were following as fast as they could. The noise was like an English
fox-hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the
hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper
and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster and faster they went as the
scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just as they came to the
last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises
another noise—a different one, which gave her a queer feeling inside. It was
a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.
Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the
reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan’s army
fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had
seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and
more evil and more deformed. There also seemed to be far more of them.
Peter’s army—which had their backs to her—looked terribly few. And there
were statues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch had been
using her wand. But she did not seem to be using it now. She was fighting
with her stone knife. It was Peter she was fighting—both of them going at it
so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening; she only saw
the stone knife and Peter’s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like
three knives and three swords. That pair were in the center. On each side the
line stretched out. Horrible things were happening wherever she looked.
“Off my back, children,” shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off.
Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the western lamp-post to the
shores of the eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White
Witch. Lucy saw her face lifted toward him for one second with an
expression of terror and amazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over
together but with the Witch underneath; and at the same moment all warlike creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch’s house rushed madly on
the enemy lines, dwarfs with their battleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant
with his club (and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe), unicorns with
their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs. And Peter’s tired army
cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered
till the wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.
Seventeen
THE HUNTING OF THE WHITE
STAG
THE BATTLE WAS ALL OVER A FEW MINUTES after their arrival.
Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his
companions; and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was
dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. The next thing that
Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange to
her to see Peter looking as he looked now—his face was so pale and stern
and he seemed so much older.
“It was all Edmund’s doing, Aslan,” Peter was saying. “We’d have been
beaten if it hadn’t been for him. The Witch was turning our troops into
stone right and left. But nothing would stop him. He fought his way through
three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue.
And when he reached her he had sense to bring his sword smashing down
on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made
a statue himself for his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were
making. Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance—if we
hadn’t lost so many already. He was terribly wounded. We must go and see
him.”
They found Edmund in charge of Mrs. Beaver a little way back from the
fighting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face
a nasty green color.
“Quick, Lucy,” said Aslan.
And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious
cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled
so much that she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the
end and poured a few drops into her brother’s mouth.
“There are other people wounded,” said Aslan while she was still
looking eagerly into Edmund’s pale face and wondering if the cordial would
have any result.
“Yes, I know,” said Lucy crossly. “Wait a minute.”
“Daughter of Eve,” said Aslan in a graver voice, “others also are at the
point of death. Must more people die for Edmund?”
“I’m sorry, Aslan,” said Lucy, getting up and going with him. And for
the next half-hour they were busy—she attending to the wounded while he
restored those who had been turned into stone. When at last she was free to
come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only
healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look—oh,
for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was
where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and
could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him
a knight.
“Does he know,” whispered Lucy to Susan, “what Aslan did for him?
Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?”
“Hush! No. Of course not,” said Susan.
“Oughtn’t he to be told?” said Lucy.
“Oh, surely not,” said Susan. “It would be too awful for him. Think how
you’d feel if you were he.”
“All the same I think he ought to know,” said Lucy. But at that moment
they were interrupted.
That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for
them all I don’t know; but somehow or other they found themselves all
sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o’clock. Next day
they began marching eastward down the side of the great river. And the
next day after that, at about teatime, they actually reached the mouth. The
castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before them
were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and seaweed, and
the smell of the sea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever
and ever on the beach. And oh, the cry of the seagulls! Have you heard it?
Can you remember?
That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the
beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between
their toes. But next day was more solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of
Cair Paravel—that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west wall
hung with peacock’s feathers and the eastern door which looks towards the
sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan
solemnly crowned them and led them to the four thrones amid deafening
shouts of, “Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live
King Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!”
“Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well,
Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!” said Aslan.
And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of
the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in
honor of their new Kings and Queens.
So the children sat on their thrones and scepters were put into their
hands and they gave rewards and honors to all their friends, to Tumnus the
Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the
good centaurs, and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there
was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed
and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter,
and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.
But amid all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And
when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn’t there they said nothing
about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them, “He’ll be coming and going,” he
had said. “One day you’ll see him and another you won’t. He doesn’t like
being tied down—and of course he has other countries to attend to. It’s
quite all right. He’ll often drop in. Only you mustn’t press him. He’s wild,
you know. Not like a tame lion.”
And now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These
two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was
their reign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the
remnants of the White Witch’s army and destroying them, and indeed for a
long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of
the forest—a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one
month and a rumor of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was
stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good
trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and
young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies
and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let
live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a different sort from Giant
Rumblebuffin) on the north of Narnia when these ventured across the
frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries
beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from
them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over
them. And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior,
and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall
and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the
kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for
her hand in marriage. And she was called Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a
graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgment. He
was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and
golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen,
and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.
So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this
world it was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that
Tumnus (who was a middle-aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout)
came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more
appeared in his parts—the White Stag who would give you wishes if you
caught him. So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal
members of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and hounds in the
Western Woods to follow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long
before they had a sight of him. And he led them a great pace over rough and
smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses of all the courtiers were
tired out and only these four were still following. And they saw the stag
enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King
Peter (for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and
Queens for so long), “Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and
follow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler
quarry.”
“Sir,” said the others, “even so let us do.”
So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick
wood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,
“Fair friends, here is a great marvel for I seem to see a tree of iron.”
“Madam,” said King Edmund, “if you look well upon it you shall see it
is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.”
“By the Lion’s Mane, a strange device,” said King Peter, “to set a
lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it
that if it were lit it should give light to no man!”
“Sir,” said Queen Lucy. “By likelihood when this post and this lamp
were set here there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For
this is a young wood and the iron post is old.” And they stood looking upon
it. Then said King Edmund,
“I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me
strangely. It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a
dream, or in the dream of a dream.”
“Sir,” answered they all, “it is even so with us also.”
“And more,” said Queen Lucy, “for it will not go out of my mind that if
we pass this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventures or else
some great change of our fortunes.”
“Madam,” said King Edmund, “the like foreboding stirreth in my heart
also.”
“And in mine, fair brother,” said King Peter.
“And in mine too,” said Queen Susan. “Wherefore by my counsel we
shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.”
“Madam,” said King Peter, “therein I pray thee to have me excused. For
never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our
hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice,
and the like, and then given over; but always what we have taken in hand,
the same we have achieved.”
“Sister,” said Queen Lucy, “my royal brother speaks rightly. And it
seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we
turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase.”
“And so say I,” said King Edmund. “And I have such desire to find the
signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the
richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.”
“Then in the name of Aslan,” said Queen Susan, “if ye will all have it
so, let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.”
So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had
gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was
called a lamp-post, and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that
they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And
next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty
room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but
just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same
day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the
wardrobe to hide. Mrs. Macready and the visitors were still talking in the
passage; but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the
children weren’t caught.
And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn’t been that
they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out
of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very
remarkable man, didn’t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but
believed the whole story. “No,” he said, “I don’t think it will be any good
trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won’t get
into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if
you did! Eh? What’s that? Yes, of course you’ll get back to Narnia again
someday. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don’t go
trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don’t try to get there at all. It’ll
happen when you’re not looking for it. And don’t talk too much about it
even among yourselves. And don’t mention it to anyone else unless you
find that they’ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What’s that?
How will you know? Oh, you’ll know all right. Odd things they say—even
their looks—will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do
they teach them at these schools?”
And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe. But if the
Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.
Step into the world of
