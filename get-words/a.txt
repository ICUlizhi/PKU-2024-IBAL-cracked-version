V. The Boston Observer
THEY WENT to the Afric Queen and ate in the dining room. This time no one
asked to see the color of Mr. Quincy's money. The party even grew a little
noisy. Isannah, Johnny, and Mr. Quincy himself were the most hilarious.
Many of the leading Whigs dined daily at the Queen, and one man after
another stopped at their table to laugh over Merchant Lyte's public
discomfiture that morning in court. Hadn't Quincy practically caught the old
fox thieving a silver cup from an apprentice? Mr. Quincy, flushed and
happy, agreed to all this, but more seriously he warned Johnny to watch out
for himself. Mr. Lyte was very proud. That pride had been hurt. From now
on he was Johnny's enemy. But all enjoyed themselves, although Isannah
drank herself sick and silly on sillabubs.
Johnny was disappointed when Rab told exactly how he had got Cilla to
court that day. It was not half so exciting a story as Johnny had expected.
Rab had simply shown Mrs. Lapham a letter signed by Governor
Hutchinson and stamped with the Great Seal of the Colony. It had been sent
to Mr. Lorne, commanding him and the other printers of Boston to quit their
seditious, rebellious publications—or else. Mrs. Lapham could not read. All
Rab had done was to take Cilla by the arm, unfurl the letter at Mrs.
Lapham, point to the seal and say, 'Governor's orders.' He had not given her
time to call the well-educated Mr. Tweedie out of the shop. Rab and Cilla
ran hell-for-leather to the courthouse. He had already schooled Isannah and
hidden her near-by in case he was unable to produce Cilla. Both girls, he
thought, had done marvelously.
'That's what Miss Lyte said,' the little girl agreed eagerly. 'At least she
said I was wonderful and...'
'Oh, forget it,' said Johnny rudely. That Isannah was just about getting
above herself.
During dinner it seemed to Rab that Johnny planned to go back to the
Laphams to sleep, and to Cilla that he was moving in with Rab. But Johnny
decided to sponge on neither—not until he had a job, and something a lot
better than delivering papers for Uncle Lorne. He had noticed the number of
boys who came and went about the Queen's stable.
The wind was howling up from the sea, beating the waves against the
wharves. It was a fine fall, the days crisp and full of sparkle, but the nights,
from now on, would be too cold in the open, although warm enough hidden
away in the stable, with hay or a horse blanket to cover one and the warm
animals giving off heat.
He slept in the stable that night and on the next day did find a sea
captain who would—in spite of the bad hand—take him on as a cabin boy.
Johnny did not like the captain, the ship, nor the voyage. It was going to
Halifax and the cold turn the weather had taken and his insufficient clothing
made him desire a trip to the tropic Sugar Isles above all else. But all
seemed settled until the shipmaster casually told him he must furnish his
own blankets, oilskins, sea boots, warm pea jacket. Johnny had no money to
buy such things.
Having no safe place now to leave his cup, he had tied the strings of the
flannel bag to his belt. It struck at him as he walked. The luckiest thing he
had ever done was to disobey his mother and show this cup to Cilla last
July. Now he would disobey her again and sell it.
There were many silversmiths who would have bought it, but the cup
was so old-fashioned he could not expect from them more than its value in
old silver. However, Mr. Lyte, owning the matching cups, would pay a very
good price. So once more he went to that merchant's counting house on
Long Wharf.
It was the same as before, except 'Cousin Sewall' was not there. The
grasshoppery old clerks were bent over their ledgers. Neither moved as
Johnny slipped quietly past them and entered the inner office.
Mr. Lyte looked up from his papers. There was a glimmer almost of
hatred in the sliding black eyes as he recognized Johnny. Mr. Justice had
humiliated him publicly, and the story had gone quickly around the
wharves, among his friends.
He spoke very quietly. 'Well?'
'Look. I have no money. No food. Only the clothes I stand in. I've no
choice. This cup is worth about four pounds if I sold it for old silver. I'm a
silversmith and I know. But to you, because it matches your others, it is
worth about four times as much. Give me twenty pounds and you can have
it.'
Through the melted tallow on his face there was a faint flush of blood.
Although his voice was suave enough, Johnny knew he was furious.
'I've never yet bought stolen goods. I'm not going to begin now—not
even with my own.'
Johnny put the cup back in its bag, but before he could tie the strings to
his belt Mr. Lyte's long fingers had reached out and taken it.
'If you will give me back my property,' Johnny said politely, 'I'll take it
to Mr. Revere or Mr. Burt. Four pounds is all I really need.'
'Now wait a moment, young man. You know you stole it. Make a clean
breast of the matter and I will not be too hard on you. Justice Dana was a
fool to be taken in by those lying girls.'
'I didn't steal it. That was settled for all time, in court.'
Once on his feet Mr. Lyte moved quickly enough. He was at the door,
blocking Johnny's escape.
'Hadden and Barton,' he said.
The old clerks came scurrying in, their pens in their hands.
'Sewall's still down the wharf seeing about molasses? Very well. We can
do what's to be done better without that puppy. Now Hadden and Barton ...
here's a boy ... that Johnny Tremain. You've heard tell...?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Shut and lock that door. He's not so sunk in poverty and vice but to
have a glimmer of conscience.'
'No, sir.'
'And so two days after Mr. Dana found him innocent of stealing my cup
he comes to me privately, confesses the theft, and wishes to return it to me.'
'Indeed! Very noble of him, sir.'
'Mr. Hadden and Mr. Barton, you are witnesses of his repentance and
voluntary return of my stolen property.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Give me my twenty pounds.' Johnny was breathing hard.
'You thick-witted, little wharf-rat. Go whistle for it. I've two respectable
witnesses who will go into court and swear that whatever I say is true. Do
you think any court in Boston, even Dana's, would listen to you and your
wretched girls if I and my clerks said contrary-wise? You daring to suggest
you are my kin!'
Johnny saw he was trapped. 'I'll get that cup back,' he said through
white lips. 'You thief...'
'Hadden, look in the street. See if Captain Bull is still about. Fetch him.'
'If anyone is hung for stealing cups, it will not be me. Wharf-rat, am I?
You gallows bird.'
'Threatening my life, is he? Now I'm not going to be too hard on you.
Ah-ha-ha-ha. As long as you had the decency to admit your theft. Having a
bad time getting work since you burned your hand, eh? Well, my Captain
Bull is taking the Unicorn to Guadalupe on ebb tide. Maybe you'd like to
settle in Guadalupe? Boston is getting a little crowded. More opportunity in
Guadalupe for lying, thieving, scurvy knaves!
Hadden came back with Captain Bull. Johnny gave the captain one
startled glance. He was an enormously powerful man, with a neck as big as
Johnny's waist and huge hands hanging down to his knees. Each hand
looked as large as a bunch of bananas. The courtly bow he attempted at his
employer only made him seem more the baboon, but this formality gave
Johnny one split second. He shot out of the inner office before Captain Bull
had recovered from his bow. Hadden flung up his bony arms trying to stop
him, but went down like a bunch of fagots.
Johnny kept on running up Long Wharf and the short length of King
Street. He dove down Crooked Lane into Dock Square, knocked over a
basket of feathers a woman was selling, for a moment was mixed up in a
drove of squealing pigs, but he knew where he was going and shot down
Union Street. Salt Lane at last, and the little man observing Boston so
genially through his spyglass. Then he stopped, looked behind him. The
street was empty. No Captain Bull. Baboons could not run that fast.
Rab was not in the shop. Only Uncle Lorne.
'Do you still want a horse boy?' He was breathing so hard he could
hardly speak.
'Why, yes,' said startled Mr. Lorne, 'sometime—but there's no such a
hurry. We've been hiring a boy from the Afric Queen for a month and...'
'Will I do?'
Mr. Lorne went to the window opening on the shop's back yard. Rab
was out there brewing up a kettle of printer's ink. The Webb twins were
learning how and fetching fagots for him.
'Rab, Rab,' his uncle called to him, 'here's that Johnny back again. Will
he do for a rider?'
'Yes.' Rab's voice, cool, haunting, drifted back on a cloud of evilsmelling black smoke from the yard.
'Very well, Johnny. Of course you know how to ride?'
'I've never been on a horse in my life.'
'Well, I'm afraid now, really...'
'I can learn.'
'Rab!'
'What?'
'Can that Johnny Tremain learn to ride a horse?'
'Yes.'
'All right, boy. You sit down and catch your breath and I'll explain. This
isn't a full-time job and I can't do more than sleep you, bait you, and clothe
you. But you'll have the first four days of the week to pick up money for
yourself, or to go on with your learning (if any). I've got a fine library. If
Rab says so, you can sleep in the loft above this shop with him. If he'd
rather go on alone, my wife will put you up across the way. The Observer is
out every Thursday and the papers are delivered to the Boston subscribers
on that day. You can do it faster on horseback, but on foot if you'd rather.
That takes most of the day. Then next day, Friday, you start about five in the
morning, and you ride through Dorchester, Roxbury, Brookline, Milton, and
so on—Rab will draw you a map—leaving a certain number of papers at
various inns. The subscribers go fetch them themselves. So late Friday or
early Saturday you cross the Charles and go through Cambridge,
Watertown, Waltham, Lexington, and so on, and last is Charlestown. From
there you cross back into Boston on the ferry Saturday night.'
Rab came in with a kettleful of the warm, black, syrupy ink. There was
not a smootch on his white shirt or leather apron. The Webbs were black as
imps from Hell.
'Rab,' said his uncle, 'where's Johnny to sleep?'
'With me, of course.'
'Well, you show him where. But first take him over to the Queen's
stables and show him that horse you bought. If ever you made a bad
bargain, it was when you gave money for that Goblin. But you take the
afternoon off and give Johnny a lesson in equitation—show him how to fall
off without getting hurt. He'll need it if he's going to ride that devil...'
Johnny's new life had begun.

'What's the matter with Goblin?' Johnny asked, a little nervously. 'Mr. Lorne
doesn't seem to hold by him much.'
'Well,' saiad Rab mildly, 'if you can ride Goblin you can really ride.
After him anything will seem easy. But that's a good way to learn. Now
remember, Johnny, there's not such a lot to riding except getting along with
your horse. Horses are timid animals at heart, but Goblin's the most timid of
all.'
'Has he been treated badly?'
'Yes—whipped because he's so timid. I got interested in him out in
Lexington where my folks live. He had four owners in one year. Each time
he was sold, he went for half price. The last owner practically gave him to
me. He's not mean, nor a bully. He's as sweet and gentle an animal as you'll
ever find. A piece of paper blowing in the street might make any horse shy
—and he's ashamed of himself next moment. But Goblin doesn't ever stop
to see what it is. He thinks maybe it's a little white dog about to bite his
heels and he jumps out of his skin and leaves. Sometimes it takes half an
hour to quiet him again. As for clothes on the line, they aren't just shirts and
petticoats. He thinks they are white hippogriffs big enough to carry horses
off in their talons. From his point of view the only sensible thing is to get
moving, and he moves pretty fast. Now what you've got to do is to get his
confidence so completely he'll know you'll never let anything hurt him—
you can't do that by whipping him. Then he'll go through Hell, a laundry
yard from his point of view, for you.'
'But I don't know how to ride.'
'It's about like dancing ... keeping rhythm. You'll learn right off. Of
course you'll be scared, but just remember this: no matter how scared you
are, he's more so.' They were entering the Afric Queen's stable.
'The horse boy who has been riding him for us has made him worse and
worse. If I had time I could get his confidence and cure him—somewhat.
Nobody could make him safe and steady. Now you just look at him. Isn't he
a beauty?'
Rab had gone into one of the many stalls and backed out a tall, slender
horse, so pale he was almost white, but flecked all over with tiny brown
marks. The mane and tail were a rich, blackish mahogany. His eyes were
glassy blue.
Rab said: 'I never saw a horse his color before. His sire was Yankee
Hero, a white horse, fastest horse I ever saw run. Narragansett breed. We
could no more afford to own one of Yankee Hero's sons than we could the
Lytes' coach unless there was some little thing wrong with him. Eh,
Goblin?'
The beautiful, wild, timid thing breathed softly, caressingly at Rab, but
at the same time the queer, crystalline eyes watched Johnny as though sure
that this was a boy who ate horses.
'Now you put on a bridle like this—see? And when winter comes, don't
ever put a cold bit in a horse's mouth. Breathe on it first. The saddle blanket
—steady, steady, Goblin—it won't hurt you. And then the saddle. Now you
lead him out in the yard. You hold the reins like this—left hand always and
the thumb on the upper side, but down on the reins. And you put your left
foot in the stirrup. If you get on from the right side and get kicked, it serves
you right. There, see how easy? On and off just like that. You hold him a
second.'
Rab went into the tavern, and when he came back he had permission to
take out the landlady's genteel nag. With Johnny on the nag and Rab on
Goblin, they went to the Common. Here were acres upon acres of meadow
and cow pasture, hard ground cleared for the drilling of militia. The sun and
the wind swept through them. Trees were turned to scarlet, gold, beefy red:
blueberry bushes to crimson. Through one patch a white cow was plodding,
seemingly up to her belly in blood. The cold, wild air was like wine in the
veins. And across the vast, blue sky, white clouds hurried before the wind
like sheep before invisible wolves.
'Easy, easy,' cried Rab. 'Easy does it.' Goblin had been cavorting,
blowing through his nostrils, begging to be let out. Rab kept him at a close
canter. The landlady's sorrel flung himself after him. Now and then Rab
would glance behind to see how Johnny was making out.
'Not so stiff ... give more. I said keep your thumb up.' Then they would
stop a moment, Rab making Johnny mount and dismount. 'Trot him from
that stump yonder, back again to me.'
Once again both in the saddle, and he was setting a faster pace. The two
horses tore across the packed earth of the drill ground, and for the first time
in his life Johnny heard that wonderful music—galloping hoofs on hard
earth.
At the end, when Goblin had got most of the play out of him, they
changed horses. Actually Goblin's gaits were so smooth he seemed easier
than the sorrel.
Johnny felt he had learned a lot in his first lesson. A few more and he
would have had no fear of Goblin. But there were no more lessons. Rab was
too busy. He was teaching Johnny to ride as he did everything else—with a
minimum expenditure of his own energy. Every day Johnny led Goblin to
the Common, for it was quite a long time before he dared ride him through
the narrow, crowded streets. And he sat in his manger and talked to him.
The idea that Goblin was more scared than he gave him great
confidence and so did Rab's belief in him and his powers to learn. He had
always been quick on his feet, rhythmic and easy in his motions. He had no
idea that learning to ride by himself, with a notoriously bad horse for one
instructor and a boy who never left his printing press for the other, he was
doing an almost impossible thing. But one day he overheard Uncle Lorne
say to Rab, 'I don't see how Johnny has done it, but he is riding real good
now.'
'He's doing all right.'
'Not scared a bit of Goblin. God knows I am.'
'Johnny Tremain is a bold fellow. I knew he could learn—if he didn't get
killed first. It was sink or swim for him—and happens he's swimming.'
This praise went to Johnny's head, but patterning his manners on Rab's
he tried not to show it.
For the first week Uncle Lorne did hire the landlady's gentle nag for
Johnny. Even with the lists and maps Rab made for him, those three days of
delivering papers, first through Boston, then circling out through the
surrounding towns and returning Saturday night by ferry from Charlestown
were confusing enough.
Soon, however, these three days of riding became a delight to him. He
was a town boy, knowing little of country ways. The ships in the harbor he
knew. The wharves and the world of shops and trade. Now he reveled in
broad harvest fields, orange pumpkins, shocked corn, frost-touched grapes.
And the towns clustering around Boston interested him.
He liked to make a handsome entrance. Even if he and Goblin had
dawdled a bit on country roads, they both liked arriving at the inns at a
gallop. Then Johnny would bustle in with his newspapers and often find the
subscribers already sitting about the taproom waiting for him. Because he
came from Boston and rode for the Observer, he was often questioned about
the political thinking at the capital. By reading the papers, talking to Rab
and Uncle Lorne, listening to the leaders of opposition about Boston, he
quickly became well informed. In only a few weeks he changed from
knowing little enough about the political excitement, and caring less, to
being an ardent Whig.
He also enjoyed the showy, queer beauty of his horse. When people on
the streets or at the taverns complimented him on his mount, there would
come the same fatuous expression on his face he had often ridiculed on
Cilla's when people stopped her and said how angelic Isannah was, but he
did not know it.
At first he fell off fairly often and it would take him half an hour to
catch the wary animal, but once a farmer's wife gave him his hat full of bad
apples and he lured Goblin easily. After that he always stuffed his pockets
with windfalls. If Goblin would approach something he feared, Johnny
rewarded him with a specked apple, but when he did fall off, he would
come home smelling like a cider press.
The boys shared the loft above the printing shop. It was reached only by
a ladder, but was large, comfortable, and had a big fireplace. There was one
odd thing about this attic and that was the number of chairs stored there. He
started to ask Rab why this was, but thought better of it, and at last Rab told
him.
It was here in the attic, ever and anon, 'The Boston Observers' met. It
was a secret club, as powerful as any in Boston, and here in the last few
years had been hatched much 'treason,' as the Tories called it. Rab did not
even tell Johnny to keep his mouth shut. He knew he would.
Breakfast they made for themselves. Dinner was sent over by Mrs.
Lorne. Supper they either got for themselves or ate at Aunt and Uncle's.
Rab's aunt was a plump, red-headed, white-skinned woman. She must have
been a variation of a well-known family pattern, for Johnny often heard
people say, as they looked at Rab, 'That boy is a regular Silsbee from
Lexington.' If he was, then she was not. But her eight-months-old son was.
He was the longest baby Johnny had ever seen, had the straightest black
hair, cried the least and ate the fastest. Never fussed, and watched the world
through enigmatic, questioning, dark eyes. Even Uncle Lorne, who might
have preferred that his only child should have repeated the fox-like,
scholarly brightness of his own face, admitted, as he looked thoughtfully at
his baby, 'That child of yours, Jenifer, is a regular Silsbee of Lexington.'
Johnny became absorbed in Goblin. He was afraid the stable boys at the
Afric Queen struck at him, bullied him because he was timid, so he took
upon himself the feeding and care of the animal. This saved Mr. Lorne a
few pennies a week on the board bill, and he generously gave the money to
Johnny. The landlord at the Queen liked the boy. When guests wished a
letter delivered faster than the dawdling post riders, he would recommend
Johnny. So once that fall he rode as far as Worcester, and again to
Plymouth. This money was divided between the owner of the horse and the
rider, and Johnny bought himself spurs, boots, and a fur-lined surtout, all
second hand.
Although Johnny held the reins in his left hand, as Rab had taught him,
many times as the horse was off on a wild tear and he was struggling to get
him once more under control, he was forced to use his crippled hand. He
could not keep it proudly in his pocket while careening about on a horse
like Goblin. Although too badly injured ever to be skillful again, it was no
longer in danger of atrophying—as it had been in Johnny's pocket. As a
silversmith he had already learned to use his left hand a certain amount.
Rab never said to him, 'Now, Johnny, you've got to learn to write with your
left hand,' but he would give him things to copy, take it for granted that he
could—and he did.
For the first four days of every week Johnny was his own master. He
spent his time exercising his horse, unless he got an order to ride express for
the Afric Queen, in learning to write with his left hand, and an orgy of
reading. Mr. Lorne had a fine library. It was as if Johnny had been starved
before and never known it. He read anything—everything. Bound back
copies of the Observer, Paradise Lost, Robinson Crusoe—once more, for
that was one of the books Rab had brought him to read in jail—Tom Jones
and Locke's Essays on Human Understanding, Hutchinson's History of
Massachusetts Bay, Chemical Essays, Spectator Papers, books on
midwifery, and manners for young ladies, Pope's Iliad. It was a world of
which he never had guessed while living with the Laphams, and now he
remembered with gratitude how his mother had struggled to teach him so
that this world might not be forever closed to him. How she had made him
read to her, when he would rather have been playing. Poor woman! Her
books had been few and mostly dull.
So he sat for hours in the Lornes' sunny parlor, the books about him
stretching to the ceiling. Mrs. Lorne never called to him to help her in the
kitchen. She, Uncle Lorne, and Rab all took it for granted that Johnny ought
to read. Mrs. Lapham could not have borne the sight of so 'idle' a boy. But
Aunt Lorne never interrupted him except to come in now and then with a
plate of hot ginger-bread or seed cakes, and once in a long time ask him if
he would mind baby as she went out marketing or visiting.
'I'll just put baby in his cradle here, and if he doesn't go right to sleep
you rock him a little with your foot.' The first time he read Tom Jones, he
got so excited he absent-mindedly rocked baby for half an hour, but even
this did not upset that regular Silsbee of Lexington. The baby gulped a little,
but took it philosophically—just like Rab. Secretly, and only when alone,
Johnny began calling him 'Rabbit.' It was easy for him to love, and he loved
the baby. He would have died before he would have let anyone guess he
was so simple, but Aunt Lorne knew. Sometimes she would come into the
kitchen quietly and hear Johnny holding long, one-sided conversations with
Rabbit. When she came into the room where he was with the child, he
would merely say scornfully, 'Aunt Lorne, I think it is wet,' and pretend to
be lost in his book.
Then she would feel so fond of the lonely boy, who never knew he was
lonely, and so amused at his pretense of scorn for something he in his heart
loved, she could not help but kiss him. She always kissed him where his
hair began to grow in the middle of his forehead. He had never known until
she told him that he had a widow's peak, which she assured him was a great
mark of beauty. 'Why, I'd give anything for a widow's peak,' she would say,
'I'd give a plate of cookies,' and off she would waddle—for she was tinyfooted and too plump—and come back with the cookies.
Johnny thought Rab was lucky to have an aunt like that.
3
This was Johnny's new life. He liked it, but was at first a little homesick for
the Laphams. He had never been so glad in his life as that Thursday, a few
weeks after he had begun delivering newspapers, when he saw Cilla and
Isannah standing by the town pump in North Square. He had left his last
paper for the day with Paul Revere and was starting back to put up his horse
at the Afric Queen. He had felt he could never again go to the Laphams'.
Mrs. Lapham and her Mr. Tweedie had been too ready to let him hang. He'd
just about kill Dove if ever he met him.
'Cilla!' he cried. She looked at him and her eyes shone.
Goblin stretched his muzzle toward the empty drinking trough.
'I'll pump him fresh water.' Cilla pumped and the horse drank gratefully.
'Cilla, do you come over often to fetch water?' It hurt him that the heavy
yoke and the two buckets which he had worn so often, to his humiliation,
had somehow descended upon her thin shoulders.
'Mr. Tweedie won't have it that Dove and Dusty stop their work. Before
breakfast they are supposed to bring in all we need for the day. When we
run short, he says we girls are to go. He's upset everything, Johnny.'
'I didn't know he had that much gumption.'
'Ma abets him. And Ma says it's not suitable for grown women like
Madge and Dorcas to be carrying buckets through the streets. So I'm the
one.'
'If you'll lead my horse,' said Johnny, 'I'll carry the water as far as Fish
Street. I'm not going into that house for a long time yet—but I'll go pretty
near. Close enough to spit at them all.'
'Still mad?'
'Sure. Of course I am. Why not?'
Isannah had wandered off because a passing clergyman had seen the
sunlight on her hair and was asking her to say the shorter catechism as
proof that she was as pious as she was beautiful. And he was giving her a
poke of sweetmeats he had bought for his wife.
'Look you, Cil,' said Johnny. 'Every Thursday, see? I'll leave Mr.
Revere's paper and I'll be here to help you, just about the same time as
today.'
'I can carry the water myself,' said Cilla stiffly.
'No, it's not just that, but ... I've been wanting to see you. And Isannah
too. I didn't know how to manage.'
They were stopping on Fish Street. It was not close enough for Johnny
to spit at his old residence, but as close as he cared to go.
'Don't you go promising, Johnny,' she said. She was stroking Goblin's
face. 'I think your horse is the most beautiful horse I ever saw. I think he
likes me already.'
'Yes, I know. But I'm going to be here every Thursday. And Sunday
afternoon, too. If there's water to carry, I'll carry it, but it's more important
that we talk. Couldn't you sneak off and meet me up by the pump?'
'Yes, I could.'
'Well, will you?' She was a 'sot' and stubborn girl.
'I don't know—but if you want me and Isannah very much, I can say ...
maybe...'
Isannah flew up to join them. She had just eaten every one of her
sweetmeats and was now exclaiming over the beauty of the paper poke,
suggesting, at least, that that was all the kind clergyman had given her—an
empty paper poke—but Johnny could smell chocolate and peppermint on
her. Cilla shouldn't let her get away with such selfishness and gluttony.
Although 'maybe' was all Cilla promised, Johnny promised much more.
'Every Thursday and every Sunday afternoon.' Those were his last
words and he thought he meant them. He thought six months, a year, six
years from now, the girls would be as dear to him as they were at that
moment.
Back once more in Goblin's saddle, he turned to watch them, Cilla bent
under the heavy load, Isannah skipping about and for no particular reason
chanting the shorter catechism once more. But maybe she had reason—
maybe another clergyman was in the offing.
There was a lump in Johnny's throat.

So far in his new life there had been one, and only one, slight
disappointment. Rab was so self-contained. It was as if nothing could come
in from the outside to upset him. He owned himself. By temperament
Johnny was expansive, easily influenced. Although Rab would have been
exactly the same if he had been the son of the wealthiest merchant or the
poorest tinker in Boston, Johnny would not. When he had been the prize
apprentice of Hancock's Wharf, the envy of all the other masters, the
principal bread-winner of the Laphams (and he knew it), he had been quite
a different boy from the arrogant, shabby young tramp of late summer and
early fall. Those marketwomen who had counted their pats of butter after he
brushed past their stands, Mrs. Lapham with her prophecies that he would
end on the gallows, had not been so far wrong. For a little while it had been
touch-and-go with him. If pushed a little farther, he might have taken to
crime—because that was what was expected of him. But no matter what
happened to Rab, good or bad fortune, good or bad reputation, he would
never change. Johnny felt he knew him but little more than at their first
meeting, but he admired him more and more all the time. Rab did not
criticize him, but he had a way of asking him why he did certain things
which had a great influence upon Johnny.
Once, as they sat in the attic toasting cheese and muffins by their hearth,
the older boy asked why he went about calling people 'squeak-pigs' and
things like that. Johnny was always ready to do his share, or more than his
share, in fanning up friendship—or enmity. Sometimes it seemed to Rab he
did not much care which.
'Why do you go out of your way to make bad feeling?'
Johnny hung his head. He could not think why.
'And take Merchant Lyte. Everybody along Long Wharf knows you
called him a gallows bird. He's not used to it.' Was it fun, he wondered—
going about letting everybody who got in your way have it?
After that Johnny began to watch himself. For the first time he learned
to think before he spoke. He counted ten that day he delivered a paper at
Sam Adams's big shabby house down on Purchase Street and the black girl
flung dishwater out of the kitchen door without looking, and soaked him. If
he had not counted ten, he would have told her what he thought of her,
black folk in general, and thrown in a few cutting remarks about her master
—the most powerful man in Boston. But counting ten had its rewards.
Sukey apologized handsomely. In the past he had never given anyone time
to apologize. Her 'oh, little master, I'se so sorry! Now you just step right
into de kitchen and I'll dry up dem close—and you can eat an apple pie as I
dries,' pleased him. And in the kitchen sat Sam Adams himself, inkhorn and
papers before him. He had a kind face, furrowed, quizzical, crookedbrowed. As Sukey dried and Johnny ate his pie, Mr. Adams watched him,
noted him, marked him, said little. But ever after when Johnny came to Sam
Adams's house, he was invited in and the great leader of the gathering
rebellion would talk with him in that man-to-man fashion which won so
many hearts. He also began to employ him and Goblin to do express riding
for the Boston Committee of Correspondence. All this because Johnny had
counted ten. Rab was right. There was no point in going off 'half-cocked.'
Twice that fall he saw Rab moved out of his customary reserve. Johnny
always spent Friday night with Rab's folks at Lexington. There were
hundreds of fine acres called 'Silsbee's Cove.' Old Grandsire, who had
brought Rab up, lived in the big house, but he had sons, grandsons,
nephews, close about him. Grandsire, Major Silsbee, was confined mostly
to his chair. An old wound he had received fighting forty years ago in the
French and Indian Wars had stiffened up on him.
At the end of harvest the Silsbees had a dance in Grandsire's big barn.
There were at least twenty Silsbees there and both Johnny and Rab came
out from Boston. The tall, powerfully built, silent Silsbee men were easy to
pick out from among the neighbors and friends invited, but Grandsire and
Rab were more completely Silsbees than anyone else.
At this country dance Johnny for the first time saw Rab move suddenly
into action. He flung himself into the dancing. Johnny thought in
amazement how nonchalant and even sluggish Rab could seem about the
printing shop, and yet he did his work with a machine-like perfection. Now
he saw the dark eyes glowing and the white teeth flash. It was amazing that
an old fiddle in Grandsire's hands and the old voice calling, 'Gents 'round
the Ladies—Ladies 'round the Gents' could work such a change in him. He
had stepped out of his imperturbable usual self. Here was a Rab Johnny had
always known existed, but had never before seen. All the Lin-das and
Betsys, Pollys, Peggys, and Sallys of Lexington were clamoring to stand up
with him. He loved to dance, and seemingly all the girls loved him and he
all the girls. Johnny, two years younger, noticed with disapproval.
One other thing happened at that barn dance that made a great
impression on Johnny. He forget entirely about his hand. Although in the
reels and jigs they danced, every moment a different girl was clinging to it,
none of them seemed to notice. Johnny spoke of this fact to Rab as they
undressed at Grandsire's. The Boston girls (he was thinking of Isannah's
words—such cruel words he had never even told Rab) had said his hand
disgusted them. He wasn't to touch them with it.
'It is you who put the idea in their heads,' said Rab, pulling off his shirt.
'You know you usually go about with that hand in your pocket, looking as if
you had an imp of Hell hidden away, and then someone asks you and you
pull it out with a slow flourish, as if you said, "This is the most disgusting
thing you ever saw." No wonder you scare everybody. Tonight happens you
just forgot.'
The other time he saw Rab moved out of himself was a few days later.
The Webb twins were timid, weakly little fellows, natural butts for any
bullies. They never seemed to need any company except each other and
their cat. Mrs. Lorne one day sent them to the butcher for stew meat, and
they, thinking it was an errand a cat might enjoy, carried her with them. The
butcher's boy was a well-known tyrant. He grabbed the Webbs' cat, trussed
her, hung her up by her heels to a hook, and began to sharpen his knife. He
was going to butcher her, skin her, and give the carcass to the Webbs for
stew meat. The butcher sat by and roared with laughter at the frantic
children's tears and cries.
Rab heard the terrified screams of the little boys. He rescued the cat,
who was the first to get home, with the Webbs on her heels. Next he began
on the butcher's boy. By then Johnny had arrived. Together they took on the
butcher, his oldest son, the butcher's wife, armed with boiling water she had
prepared for scalding pigs, her mother, and a passer-by. Yet before the
constable had arrived, Rab was out of it, back cleaning his press, and he had
got Johnny out of it, too. Johnny had a black eye, a lame shoulder, a torn
shirt, a bite in his wrist—that was the butcher's wife's mother; she had good
teeth for seventy. Rab had nothing except an uncommonly high color in his
face and a look of intense pleasure. It was strange that a boy who could
fight like that and enjoy it so intensely never quarreled, never fought, and
he had almost nothing to say about this really Homeric battle. But for days
afterward Johnny would see a look of dreamy content in his eyes, a slow
smile form absent-mindedly on his lips. Rab was thinking of the fun he and
Johnny had had at the butcher's shop. All he would say was, 'We certainly
made hash of that shop.' The boy was a born fighter—ferocious, utterly
fearless, quick and powerful—but he didn't fight often and he hadn't much
to say afterward.
Seemingly Silsbees were like that. Johnny had already seen a pack of
them out at Lexington, and there over at the Lornes was Rabbit repeating
the old pattern. One day Aunt Lorne came in as Johnny sat reading, with the
baby in her arms.
For once she looked a little discouraged. 'My land, I don't know what's
wrong with baby. There's something—and he won't tell me—'
'Isn't he pretty young to tell much?'
'Oh, no, no. Other babies can tell you whether it's gas or a pin, or milk
souring on them. But he's a real Silsbee, and they never do, you know.'
'Aren't you a Silsbee too?'
'Me? Oh, no. Thank Heaven, it skipped me. Look at my red hair—and
my build. I'm just like Mother—a mere Wheeler. I can say what hurts me—
sometimes before I'm hurt. Those Silsbees—they just about can't. They
don't tell anything, but they are about the best men ever lived. If you'll just
learn to take 'em or leave 'em.'
Johnny was learning to 'take or leave' Rab.

VI. Salt-Water Tea

ON SUNDAYS the boys might relax a little, breakfast when they pleased, only
they must turn up clean and shining in time to go to church with Aunt and
Uncle and listen to the inflammatory Reverend Sam Cooper. Doctor Cooper
was putting more politics than gospel into his sermons that fall and more fear
of 'taxation without representation' than God into his congregation.
England had, by the fall of 1773, gone far in adjusting the grievances of
her American colonies. But she insisted upon a small tax on tea. Little money
would be collected by this tax. It worked no hardship on the people's
pocketbooks: only threepence the pound. The stubborn colonists, who were
insisting they would not be taxed unless they could vote for the men who taxed
them, would hardly realize that the tax had been paid by the East India
Company in London before the tea was shipped over here. After all, thought
Parliament, the Americans were yokels and farmers—not political thinkers.
And the East India tea, even after that tax was paid, would be better and
cheaper than any the Americans ever had. Weren't the Americans, after all,
human beings? Wouldn't they care more for their pocketbooks than their
principles?
Shivering—for the last week in November was bitterly cold—Johnny built
up the fire in the attic. From the back window he could see that the roofs of the
Afric Queen were white with frost.
A sharp rat-tat on the shop door below woke Rab.
'What time's it?' he grumbled, as people do who think they are disturbed
too early Sunday morning.
'Seven and past. I'll see what's up.'
It was Sam Adams himself. When either cold or excited, his palsy
increased. His head and hands were shaking. But his strong, seamed face,
which always looked cheerful, today looked radiant. Sam Adams was so
pleased that Johnny, a little naively, thought he must have word that Parliament
had backed down again. The expected tea ships had not sailed.
'Look you, Johnny. I know it's Lord's Day, but there's a placard I must have
printed and posted secretly tonight. The Sons of Liberty will take care of the
posting, but Mr. Lorne must see to the printing. Could you run across and ask
him to step over? And Rab—where's he?'
Rab was coming down the ladder.
'What's up?' said Rab sleepily.
'The first of the tea ships, the Dartmouth, is entering the harbor. She'll be at
Castle Island by nightfall.'
'So they dared send them?'
'Yes.'
'And the first has come?'
'Yes. God give us strength to resist. That tea cannot be allowed to land.'
When Johnny got back with Mr. Lorne, Rab had Mr. Adams's text in his
hands, reading it as a printer reads, thinking first of spacing and capitals, not of
the meaning.
'I can set that in no time. Two hundred copies? They'll be fairly dry by
nightfall.'
'Ah, Mr. Lorne,' said Adams, shaking hands, 'without you printers the
cause of liberty would be lost forever.'
'Without you'—Mr. Lorne's voice shook with emotion—'there would not
have been any belief in liberty to lose. I will, as always, do anything—
everything you wish.'
'I got word before dawn. It's the Dartmouth and she will be as far as Castle
Island by nightfall. If that tea is landed—if that tax is paid—everything is lost.
The selectmen will meet all day today and I am calling a mass meeting for
tomorrow. This is the placard I will put up.'
He took it from Rab's hands and read:
Friends! Brethren! Countrymen! That worst of Plagues,
the detested tea shipped for this Port by the East India
Company, is now arrived in the Harbour: the hour of
destruction, of manly opposition to the machinations of
Tyranny, stares you in the Face; Every Friend to his
Country, to Himself, and to Posterity, is now called upon to
meet at Faneuil Hall, at nine o'clock this day [that, of
course, is tomorrow Monday], at which time the bells will
ring to make united and successful resistance to this last,
worst, and most destructive measure of Administration....
Boston, Nov. 29, 1773.
Then he said quietly: 'Up to the last moment—up to the eleventh hour, we
will beg the Governor's permission for the ships' return to London with their
cargo. We have twenty days.'
Johnny knew that by law any cargo that was not unloaded within twenty
days might be seized by the custom-house and sold at auction.
'Mr. Lorne, needless to say the Observers will meet tonight. There are
private decisions to be made before the mass meeting tomorrow at nine.'
Johnny pricked up his ears. Ever since he had come to Mr. Lorne's (and
Rab said he might be trusted with anything—possibly with men's lives) he had
now and then summoned the members of the Observers' Club. They were so
close to treason they kept no list of members. Rab made Johnny memorize the
twenty-two names. They met in Rab and Johnny's attic.
'Johnny,' said Mr. Lorne, anxious and overanxious to please Mr. Adams,
'start right out.'
'No, sir, if you please. Noon will be better. That will give the members
time to get home from church. And as usual, Johnny, make no stir. Simply say,
"Mr. So and So owes eight shillings for his newspaper." '
Johnny nodded. That meant the meeting would be tonight at eight o'clock.
If he said one pound eight shillings, it would mean the next night at eight. Two
pounds, three and six would mean the day after at three-thirty. It gave him a
feeling of excitement and pleasure to be even on the fringes of great, secret,
dangerous events.
Today he could not make his rounds on horseback. A constable might stop
him and ask embarrassing questions. There was a law against riding out on
Sunday for either business or pleasure.
The Reverend Samuel Cooper he 'dunned' as he was shaking hands with
his parishioners at the end of the service. He nodded as Johnny told him that
eight shillings were due on the paper, but a fashionable woman standing by
said it was a fair scandal for boys to be intruding into God's house and dunning
a clergyman, and if collecting bills wasn't work, what was? She would call a
constable and have the 'impertinent imp' whipped for Sabbath-breaking. Mr.
Cooper had to cough so he could pretend not to be laughing, and he winked at
Johnny in spite of the dignity of his black clericals, white bands, and great
woolly wig.
'I'll tell my brother William, too, eh?' he offered. 'Brother William and I
will both pay you tonight.'
Johnny found four more of the members also at this meeting and then
headed for Beacon Hill. At all the great mansions he commonly went to the
back door, either to leave newspapers or to 'collect bills.' A skinny, slipperylooking old black slave in the kitchen told him Mr. Hancock was in bed with a
headache. No, she would not permit Johnny to go to his bedchamber. So the
boy went to the front door, rang the bell, hoping some other less obdurate
servant might let him in. Maybe little Jehu. The old slave guessed what he was
up to and got there first.
Might he not send a note up to Mr. Hancock? They wrangled a little and at
last she said yes he might. She was preparing a catnip tea to send to the master.
He could write a note and put it on the tray. In the kitchen he wrote his note
—'Mr. Hancock owes the Boston Observer eight shillings,' folded it, and on
the outside wrote, 'John Hancock, Esquire.' Was it only two months before he
had tried to write those very words and failed so miserably?
The cook was squatting at the hearth toasting thin toast. Johnny lifted the
teapot to set his note under it. That teapot ... its handle was in the shape of a
winged woman! Beside it was the creamer that he had loved so much. Even
now he could shut his eyes and feel it in his hands. Ah ... a sugar basin to
match! Mr. Hancock had indeed found a smith to make it after Mr. Lapham
failed so lamentably. Behind the cook's back Johnny lifted it in trembling
hands. The handles were wrong. Done exactly as Johnny had started to do
them before he talked with Mr. Revere.
He thought with longing, but contentment, of that other basin ... the one
that had been exactly right and never completed. This one he held in his hands
was nothing, trash. But how beautiful ... how perfect, had been the other one!
'If I had to hurt my hand, I'm glad it was while doing something worth while—
not merely mending an old spoon.'
The cook's wiry black fingers were in his hair.
'You no-account! Don't you never think to go stealing sugar in this house.
Mr. Hancock is that generous I'd have given you a piece if you had asked
politely.'
Next to the Hancock house was the Lytes'. Mr. Lyte, in his effort to play
both ends against the middle, did take the Observer and every Thursday
Johnny habitually crossed from one stable yard to the other. There was no
reason he should do so today. But it was as he told Cilla—he just about
couldn't help watching the Lytes. What did they do on Sundays? Would the
merchant be home today? He might have asked Captain Bull to dine with him.
Would he see Miss Lavinia—or only the fat cook, the scullery maids, Aunt
Best, or the stable men?
The cobbled stable yard was deserted. He did not hear the usual chatter
from the kitchen. He glanced at the dining-room window—the one Mr. Lyte
thought he broke the night the cup was stolen. Doubtless now that cup Mr.
Lyte had actually stolen from him stood with the other three on the sideboard.
His jaw clenched. Sometime, someday, he would get it back, and not by
snitching it either.
A horse came clattering into the stable yard. Contrary to law and decent
propriety, Miss Lavinia had been out for a gallop on the Common. Her black
horse was wet and foaming. The young woman sat her side-saddle superbly.
Her dark green London habit almost swept the ground. He knew that she had
recognized him as the boy who had 'stolen the cup,' the very first time she had
met him delivering papers at her house, but she pretended not to. Now she
glanced at him and the chisel mark between the sweeping black brows
deepened.
'Williams!' she cried. 'Dolbear!'
There was no groom at the stable to help her dismount. The black horse
reared. Johnny smiled. He knew enough about equitation to realize she was
showing off. Johnny could make Goblin rear like that any time he pleased. It
amused him that she pretended such contempt for him and yet condescended to
show off her skill before him.
'Well, you then!' she cried to him. With her nervous horse and long skirts it
was impossible for her to dismount from a sidesaddle without help. He gave
her the help. She did not thank him. It was as if she knew that proximity to
such famous beauty was reward enough for any boy or man in Boston. If
anyone thanked, obviously it should be Johnny. He thought she was the most
disagreeable woman he had ever seen, and yet the fact was he had slipped thus
into the Lytes' yard in the hope of seeing her—even risking Captain Bull and
that threatened trip to Guadalupe. He liked to tell Rab how awful she was—
and then would sneak back to take another look.
Near-by was William Molineaux's house. Its seedy appearance advertised
to the whole world that its owner was close to bankruptcy. Mr. Molineaux was
standing in his orchard, shaking his cane at a couple of small boys he had treed
in an apple tree. He had a terrible temper, which he thoroughly enjoyed.
Although Johnny told him three times about those eight shillings, he was not
sure whether the idea had penetrated the wild Irishman's thick skull or not. Nor
did he care.
His good friend, Josiah Quincy, plump little John Adams, and James Otis
he found together at the Quincy house. They were still sitting over their port
and cracking nuts. James Otis did not even look up when Johnny entered. He
was hunched up in his chair, his thick-skulled, heavy head hung forward. He
was busy drawing a row of little people on the paper before him. Quincy,
having already heard about the meeting that night, put a finger to his lips and
shook his head, at the same time glancing at the heavy, lonely figure of Otis.
Johnny guessed that neither he nor John Adams wanted Otis notified of the
meeting, although he was a member.
For four years Otis had been crazy and sane, turn and turn about, on again
and off again. He was the most brilliant man of them all, thought in the largest
terms, not ever merely of Boston; was passionate in his demand for the rights
of Englishmen everywhere—over here and in Old England too. Now he was
not even listening to what was going on about him. His heavy head was
swinging back and forth. John Adams and Josiah Quincy were watching him
so intently their heads were also moving a little. Johnny stole out and closed
the door softly after him. He guessed that in a day or two he'd hear it
whispered, James Otis had got into a mad freak and fired guns from the
windows of his house: James Otis had been seen leaving Boston in a closed
chaise with a doctor and in a straitjacket.
Next he went to Doctor Church. Here was a queer man surely. He was still
in his bedgown and slippers, with paper, inkhorn, and pens about him, writing
poetry. Johnny did not care for Molineaux because he bellowed and roared so
loudly. But he disliked Doctor Church. He did not know one thing against him,
but he felt the man was crooked, and he knew that Paul Revere and Joseph
Warren felt as he felt about Church.
Doctor Warren was in Roxbury tending a sick woman. His wife bade
Johnny come back at five.
2
Johnny had saved Paul Revere for the last because he lived at North Square
and, being a Sunday, he knew that Cilla and Isannah would be waiting for him
by the town pump. Guiltily he remembered he had not bothered to meet them
last Thursday, nor the Sunday before, nor the Thursday before that.
He glanced about. The girls were not there, and secretly he was relieved.
He went on to Mr. Revere's. The silversmith was busy drawing a political
cartoon concerning tea and tyranny. He did not draw well—not the way he
made silver. As he drew, his children crowded about him, standing on the
rungs of his chair, breathing down his neck, dropping crumbs of ginger-bread
into his hair; but Paul Revere took all this confusion as he took everything
else, without any fussing.
'I believe I owe you eight shillings?' he said, with a wide smile on his dark,
ruddy face. The eyes gleamed.
Now there was only Doctor Warren left; then he'd go back and help Rab
set out all those chairs in the attic, get ready for the meeting that night. But
Cilla and Isannah were standing by the pump. Cilla looked little and forlorn.
The delicate face was pale. Things were not going too well for the Laphams.
Cilla was a little shabby. The sight of her touched Johnny's heart. He pitied her
—and yet he wished she had not come. Now it seemed years ago, not months,
that he had lived at the Laphams', and then surely Cilla and Isannah were the
only friends he had. But he had on going to the Observer entered a new, vast,
and exciting world. He had made new friends. He was absorbed in the
excitement over the tea, over the secret meeting tonight. Of all of these things
and people Cilla knew nothing, nor could he tell her, yet he tried to show
interest in what she had to tell him. Once he would have been very interested.
Now he felt like a hypocrite, and because he was uncomfortable he blamed it
in some way on Cilla.
Had Mr. Tweedie decided whether he would marry Madge or Dorcas?
Cilla hoped he would choose Madge. Dorcas was just about crazy over
Frizel, Junior. She said she would elope with him if Ma tried to make her
marry Tweedie.
How was Dove?
Just like always.
Dusty?
Hadn't he heard? Dusty had run away to sea.
Old master?
No, he had not even stepped inside his shop since he had signed with Mr.
Tweedie. He said he hadn't long to live and he was going to spend all his time
preparing to meet his Maker.
But Johnny wasn't really interested in all this news. He was absorbed with
the meeting this night—the tea ships. It bothered him a little that Cilla was so
faithful. There had been many and many a Sunday when he did not get to
North Square. He was too busy with Rab and his new world. But he knew that
Cilla, usually as today toting Isannah along with her, never failed. She said she
understood he could not always keep his schedule, but if he had tried harder he
could certainly have done a lot better. That very feminine faithfulness of the
girl irritated him, but he had not admitted this to himself. She took it for
granted that Johnny had not changed, and he had changed much. If, the winter
of seventy-three, Johnny Tremain had a romantic attachment to anyone, it was
to that black-haired and, as far as he knew, black-hearted, bad-tempered,
disagreeable, conceivable 'cousin' of his Miss Lavinia Lyte. Certainly not
Priscilla Lapham.
Isannah especially got on his nerves. She was showing off more and more
all the time. She knew that if she kept her hood off someone would come along
and say how pretty she was. Even now an elderly clergyman was approaching,
opening his mouth.
Johnny did not stop to hear. He left.
Doctor Warren was back from Roxbury. He was sitting in his surgery, still
in his riding boots and spurs.
'Eight shillings, sir,' said Johnny.
'I guessed we'd meet tonight. I'll be there ... but wait a moment. I promised
this article to Mr. Lorne this morning—got held up. Woman fell out of an
apple tree. Broken thigh...' He went on writing.
He was a fine-looking young man, with fresh skin and thick blond hair and
very bright blue eyes.
Even a horse boy merely entering that surgery would feel confidence in
him and his skill. Johnny took off the red mittens Aunt Lorne had knit for him
and stretched his hands toward the fire blazing on the hearth.
The pen stopped scratching. Doctor Warren had stopped writing, and,
although his back was to him, Johnny knew those clean, clear blue eyes were
staring at him. They were staring at his crippled hand.
Instantly Johnny thrust it back into his breeches pocket. He straightened
himself unconsciously, preparing to be either sullen or arrogant.
'My boy,' came the doctor's gentle voice, 'let me see your hand.'
Johnny did not face him. He said nothing.
'You don't want me to look at it?'
As long as it might take to count ten, there was complete silence. Then the
boy said, 'No, sir—thank you.'
'Was it God's will it should be so?' Doctor Warren meant was it crippled
from birth. If so, it would be harder for him to help.
'Yes,' said Johnny, thinking of how he had ruined it upon a Lord's Day.
'God's will be done,' said the young doctor.
He went back to his writing.
3
Outside, Johnny could hear shouting, yelling, whistles, the running of feet.
With the coming of night, the Sons of Liberty were abroad, tacking up Mr.
Adams's placards. Tonight Rab was not out with them, although he had been
off once or twice of late helping to frighten the tea consignees out of Boston to
the protection of a handful of British soldiers stationed on Castle Island.
Johnny was too young to be a 'Son.' But when the Observers met, the boys
always stayed in the room below to run errands for them, and it was always
Rab who mixed the fragrant punch with which the meetings ended.
All over Boston was a feeling of excitement. Everyone knew that the
Dartmouth was but a few miles away. Great events were brewing. Johnny went
to the door to see what the clamor was. A courageous Tory was chasing the
men whom he had found tacking a placard on his property. They had let him
chase them thus far to dark Salt Lane and now had turned on him. Such street
brawling made Johnny feel sick. He closed the door, sat down beside Rab, and
began slicing lemons, oranges, and limes.
'Rab...'
'Yes?'
'What will they decide ... those men upstairs?'
'You heard Sam Adams. If possible, the ships will sail home again with
their tea. We've got twenty days.'
'But if the Governor won't agree?'
'He won't. You don't know Hutchinson. I do. And you saw how happy Sam
was this morning? He knows the Governor a lot better than I do.'
'And then ... and what next, Rab?'
Johnny heard blows and oaths from the street outside. His hands shook. He
put down the knife so Rab wouldn't know. They were doing something—
something awful, to the Tory.
'As soon as we go upstairs with our punch, we'll know. Look at Sam
Adams. If he looks as pleased as an old dog fox with a fat pullet in his mouth,
we'll know they've agreed to violence if everything else fails. He doesn't care
much any more about our patching up our differences with England. He'd just
about welcome a war.'
'But the King's warships are in the harbor. They'll protect the tea. They'll
fight.'
'We can fight, too.' Rab was putting the last delicate touches to his
ketteleful of brew, for tonight the punch would be hot. He was grating
nutmegs, cautiously sprinkling in cloves, and breaking up cinnamon bark.
'Taste it, Johnny. That Madeira Mr. Hancock brought with him is firstclass.'
But Johnny heard a low moaning in the street, close to the shut door. That
Tory, who had been so brave—and foolish—as to follow the Sons of Liberty
down a black alley was alone now—was sobbing, not from pain but from
humiliation. Johnny declined to taste the punch.
Mr. Lorne called down the ladder.
'Boys, ready with your punch?'
'They made up their minds fast tonight,' said Rab. 'I rather thought they
would.'
Johnny carried a handful of pewter cups and the big wooden bowl. Rab
followed with two pitchers of his spicy brew.
The attic where the boys commonly slept looked strange enough with
those chairs pulled out and arranged for the meeting. John Hancock sat in the
moderator's chair. His face looked white and drawn. Probably his head still
ached. Beside him was Sam Adams leaning toward him, whispering and
whispering. Johnny thought how the Tories were saying that Sam Adams
seduced John Hancock, even as the Devil had seduced Eve—by a constant
whispering in his ear.
Adams turned his face as Johnny set down the wooden bowl on the baizecovered box before the moderator. Johnny had never seen an old dog fox with
a fat pullet in his mouth, but he recognized the expression when he saw it. Rab
poured the punch and instantly the tense silence was broken. The men were on
their feet, crowding up about the bowl. Rab and Johnny were well known.
Here was Paul Revere clinking his cup with Rab, and John Hancock was
telling Johnny how far too well his old slave woman guarded his privacy.
Actually three men had come to the house to tell him the first of the tea ships
had been sighted, but he had not known anything was afoot until he got
Johnny's 'bill' on his tray. Then he guessed what had happened.
'Here's to December the sixteenth.'
'Hear! Hear!'
They drank to that last day, the day on which the tea must be destroyed—
unless it was allowed to return to England. And Johnny saw that Sam Adams
had carried them all with him. They did not honestly want the tea returned and
a peaceful settlement made. They wanted grievances and more grievances ...
well, yes, armed warfare. Things were in such a state they did not honestly
believe there could be any permanent, friendly settlement with the mother
country.
Johnny looked about through the haze of tobacco smoke. There was
Doctor Warren. He was talking with Uncle Lorne and John Adams about that
article he had written for the newspaper. Suddenly he lifted his head, smiled,
almost laughed.
Johnny did not know why Warren smiled. Why had Johnny been such a
fool ... why couldn't he have shown his hand to the doctor? He bit into his
lower lip. After his rudeness to Doctor Warren, he did not see how he ever
could go to him and say, 'I've changed my mind. I want you to look at it. I
think you are the only person in the world who can help me.' So when Doctor
Warren, a little later, looked toward Johnny ready to smile, forgive his
discourtesy, the boy looked away. He was so embarrassed he was rude again.
Sam Adams was standing at the far end of the room and Mr. Hancock still
sat, his head in his hands. Adams clapped slightly and instantly conversation
stopped.
'Gentlemen,' he said, 'tonight we have made our decision—and know the
method by which the detested tea can be destroyed, if the ships are not allowed
to return. Here we have with us two of exactly—ah—the sort of boys or young
men we intend to use for our great purpose. Two boys in whom we have
implicit trust. If it is the wish of the assembled club members, I suggest we
approach them with our proposition tonight ... enlist their aid. Twenty days
will be up before we know. We'd best get on with our plans.'
The members once more took their seats, but the pewter cups of punch
were passing from hand to hand. Only Will Molineaux was too restless to sit.
He was muttering to himself. Ben Church sat alone. He often did. No one
really liked him.
All agreed the boys were to be told.
'First,' Adams said to the boys, 'raise your right hands. Swear by the great
name of God Himself never, for as long as you live, to divulge to anyone the
secret matters now trusted to you. Do you so swear?'
The boys swore.
Hancock was not looking at them. He sat with his aching head in his
hands.
'There's no chance—not one—those ships will be allowed to return. The
mass meetings which will be held almost daily demanding the return of the tea
are to arouse public opinion and to persuade the world we did not turn to
violence until every other course had been blocked to us. When the twenty
days are up, on the night of the sixteenth of December, those ships are going to
be boarded. That tea will be dumped in Boston Harbor. For each ship, the
Dartmouth, the Eleanor, and the brig, the Beaver, we will need thirty stout,
honest, fearless men and boys. Will you be one, Rab?'
He did not say Rab and Johnny, as the younger boy noticed. Was this
because he thought Johnny too cripple-handed for chopping open sea chests—
or merely because he knew Rab better and he was older?
'Of course, sir.'
'How many other boys could you find for the night's work? Strong and
trustworthy boys—for if one ounce of tea is stolen, the whole thing becomes a
robbery—not a protest?'
Rab thought.
'Eight or ten tonight, but give me a little time so I can feel about a bit and I
can furnish fifteen or twenty.'
'Boys who can keep their mouths shut?'
'Yes.'
Paul Revere said, 'I can furnish twenty or more from about North Square.'
'Not one is to be told in advance just what the work will be, nor who the
others are, nor the names of the men who instigated this tea party—that is, the
gentlemen gathered here tonight. Simply, as they love their country and liberty
and hate tyranny, they are to gather in this shop on the night of December
sixteenth, carrying with them such disguises as they can think of, and each
armed with an axe or hatchet.'
'It will be as you say.'
The discussion became more general. Each of these three groups must
have a leader, men who could keep discipline.
'I'll go, for one,' said Paul Revere.
Doctor Warren warned him. 'Look here, Paul, it has been decided this work
must be done by apprentices, strangers—folk little known about Boston. The
East India Company may bring suit. If you are recognized...'
'I'll risk it.'
Uncle Lorne was motioning to the boys to leave the conspirators. They did
not want to leave, but they did.
4
Both the boys were in their truckle beds. The loft still smelled of tobacco and
the spices of the punch.
Johnny moved restlessly on his bed.
'Rab?'
'Uh?'
'Rab ... those boys you promised. Am I one?'
'Of course.'
'But my hand ... What will we have to do?'
'Chop open tea chests. Dump tea in the harbor.'
'Rab?'
'Hummmmm?'
'How can I ever ... chop?'
'You've twenty days to practice in. Logs in back yard need splitting.'
'Rab...'
But the older boy was asleep.
Johnny was so wide awake he couldn't close his eyes. Old Meeting struck
midnight. He settled himself again. Surely if he tried hard enough he could
sleep. He was thinking of those tea ships, the Dartmouth, the Eleanor, the
Beaver, great white sails spread softly, sweeping on and on through the night to
Boston. Nearer, nearer. He was almost asleep, twitched, and was wide awake.
He would not think of the tea ships, but of those logs in the back yard he
would practice on. He thought of Doctor Warren. Oh, why had he not let him
see his hand? Cilla, waiting and waiting for him at North Square—and then he
got there only about when it pleased him. He loved Cilla. She and Rab were
the best friends he had ever had. Why was he mean to her? He couldn't think.
He would take an axe in his left hand and chop, chop, chop ... so he fell asleep.
Something large and white was looming up over him—about to run him
down. He struggled awake, sat up, and found he was sweating. It was the great
sails of the tea ships.
From the bed next to him he heard the soft, slow breathing of the older
boy. So much more involved than Johnny in the brewing storm, Rab had been
able to drop off immediately. Somehow Johnny must draw into himself
something of Rab's calm, his nerveless strength. He began to breathe in unison
with the sleeping boy—so slowly, so softly. He fell into a heavy sleep.
5
Next morning Johnny was up and out in the back yard early. At first it seemed
impossible to hold an axe in his left hand, steady it with his bad right. He
gritted his teeth and persevered. Rab said nothing of his struggles. He merely
set type, pulled proofs as usual. But often he was gone from home, and Johnny
knew he was 'feeling about' for those fifteen to twenty boys he had promised.
Would the others go and Johnny be left behind? He could not bear the thought,
and Rab had promised him that in twenty days he might learn to chop. Having
finished the logs in Mr. Lorne's back yard, he began chopping (free gratis) for
the Afric Queen.
Almost every day and sometimes all day, the mass meetings at Old South
Church went on. Tempers grew higher and higher. Boston was swept with a
passion it had not known since the Boston Massacre three years before. Riding
this wild storm was Sam Adams and his trusty henchmen, directing it, building
up the anger until, although the matter was not publicly mentioned, they would
all see the only thing left for them to do was to destroy the tea.
Sometimes Rab and Johnny went to these meetings. It happened they were
there when the sheriff arrived and bade the meeting forthwith to disperse. He
said it was lawless and treasonable. This proclamation from Governor
Hutchinson was met with howls and hisses. They voted to disobey the order.
Sometimes the boys slipped over to Griffin's Wharf. By the eighth of
December the Eleanor had joined the Dartmouth. These were strange ships.
They had unloaded their cargoes—except the tea. The Town of Boston had
ordered them not to unload the tea and the law stated they could not leave until
they had unloaded. Nor would the Governor give them a pass to return to
England. At Castle Island the British Colonel Leslie had orders to fire upon
them if they attempted to sneak out of the harbor. The Active and the
Kingfisher, British men-of-war, stood by ready to blast them out of the water if
they obeyed the Town and returned to London with the tea. The ships were
held at Griffin's Wharf as though under an enchantment.
Here was none of the usual hustle and bustle. Few of the crew were in
sight, but hundreds of spectators gathered every day merely to stare at them.
Johnny saw Rotch, the twenty-three-year-old Quaker who owned the
Dartmouth, running about in despair. The Governor would not let him leave.
The Town would not let him unload. Between them he was a ruined man. He
feared a mob would burn his ship. There was no mob, and night and day armed
citizens guarded the ships. They would see to it that no tea was smuggled
ashore and that no harm was done to the ships. Back and forth paced the guard.
Many of their faces were familiar to Johnny. One day even John Hancock took
his turn with a musket on his shoulder, and the next night he saw Paul Revere.
Then on the fifteenth, the third of the tea ships arrived. This was the brig,
the Beaver.
6
The next day, the sixteenth, Johnny woke to hear the rain drumming sadly on
the roof, and soon enough once more he heard all the bells of Boston cling-
clanging, bidding the inhabitants come once more, and for the last time, to Old
South to demand the peaceful return of the ships to England.
By nightfall, when the boys Rab had selected began silently to congregate
in the office of the Observer, behind locked doors, the rain stopped. Many of
them Johnny knew. When they started to assume their disguises, smootch their
faces with soot, paint them with red paint, pull on nightcaps, old frocks, torn
jackets, blankets with holes cut for their arms, they began giggling and
laughing at each other. Rab could silence them with one look, however. No one
passing outside the shop must guess that toward twenty boys were at that
moment dressing themselves as 'Indians.'
Johnny had taken some pains with his costume. He had sewed for hours on
the red blanket Mrs. Lorne had let him cut up and he had a fine mop of
feathers standing upright in the old knitted cap he would wear on his head, but
when he started to put on his disguise, Rab said no, wait a minute.
Then he divided the boys into three groups. Beside each ship at the wharf
they would find a band of men. 'You,' he said to one group of boys, 'will join
the boarding party for the Dartmouth. You for the Eleanor. You for the Beaver.'
Each boy was to speak softly to the leader and say, 'Me Know You,' for that
was the countersign. They would know the three leaders because each of them
would wear a white handkerchief about the neck and a red string about the
right wrist. Then he turned to Johnny.
'You can run faster than any of us. Somehow get to Old SouthChurch. Mr.
Rotch will be back from begging once more the Governor's permission for the
ships to sail within a half-hour. Now, Johnny, you are to listen to what Sam
Adams says next. Look you. If Mr. Adams then says, "Now may God help my
country," come back here. Then we will take off our disguises and each go
home and say nothing. But if he says, "This meeting can do nothing more to
save the country," you are to get out of that crowd as fast as you can, and as
soon as you get into Cornhill begin to blow upon this silver whistle. Run as
fast as you are able back here to me and keep on blowing. I'll have boys posted
in dark corners, close enough to the church, but outside the crowd. Maybe
we'll hear you the first time you blow.'
About Old South, standing in the streets, inside the church, waiting for
Rotch to return with the very last appeal that could be made to the Governor,
was the greatest crowd Boston had ever seen—thousands upon thousands.
There was not a chance, not one, Johnny could ever squirm or wriggle his way
inside, but he pushed and shoved until he stood close to one of the doors.
Farther than this he could not go—unless he walked on people's heads. It was
dark already.
Josiah Quincy's voice rang out from within. 'I see the clouds roll and the
lightning play, and to that God who rides the whirlwind and directs the storm, I
commit my country...'
The words thrilled Johnny, but this was not what he was waiting for, and it
was not Sam Adams speaking. He was bothered with only one thing. Quincy
had a beautiful carrying voice. It was one thing to hear him and another Sam
Adams, who did not speak well at all.
The crowd made way for a chaise. 'Rotch is back! Make way for Rotch!'
Mr. Rotch passed close to Johnny. He was so young he looked almost ready to
cry. This was proof enough that the Governor had still refused. Such a turmoil
followed Rotch's entry, Johnny could not hear any one particular voice. What
chance had he of hearing Sam Adams's words? He had his whistle in his hand,
but he was so jammed into the crowd about the door that he did not believe he
would be able to get his hand to his mouth.
'Silence.' That was Quincy again. 'Silence, silence, Mr. Adams will speak.'
Johnny twisted and turned and brought the whistle to his lips.
And suddenly there was silence. Johnny guessed there were many in that
crowd who, like himself, were hanging on those words. Seemingly Mr. Adams
was calmly accepting defeat, dismissing the meeting, for now he was saying,
'This meeting can do nothing more to save the country.'
Johnny gave his first shrill blast on his whistle, and he heard whistles and
cries seemingly in all directions, Indian war whoops, and 'Boston Harbor a
teapot tonight!' 'Hurrah for Griffin's Wharf!' 'Salt-water tea!' 'Hi, Mohawks, get
your axes and pay no taxes!'
Johnny was only afraid all would be over before Rab and his henchmen
could get to the wharf. Still shrilling on the whistle, he fought and floundered
against the tide of the crowd. It was sweeping toward Griffin's Wharf, he
struggling to get back to Salt Lane. Now he was afraid the others would have
gone on without him. After all, Rab might have decided that Johnny's legs and
ears were better than his hands—and deliberately let him do the work that best
suited him. Johnny pushed open the door.
Rab was alone. He had Johnny's blanket coat, his ridiculous be-feathered
knitted cap in his hands.
'Quick!' he said, and smootched his face with soot, drew a red line across
his mouth running from ear to ear. Johnny saw Rab's eyes through the mask of
soot. They were glowing with that dark excitement he had seen but twice
before. His lips were parted. His teeth looked sharp and white as an animal's.
In spite of his calm demeanor, calm voice, he was charged and surcharged with
a will to action, a readiness to take and enjoy any desperate chance. Rab had
come terrifyingly alive.
They flung themselves out of the shop.
'Roundabout!' cried Rab. He meant they would get to the wharf by back
alleys.
'Come, follow me. Now we're really going to run.'
He flew up Salt Lane in the opposite direction from the waterfront. Now
they were flinging themselves down back alleys (faster and faster). Once they
had a glimpse of a blacksmith shop and other 'Indians' clamoring for soot for
their faces. Now slipping over a back-yard fence, now at last on the waterfront,
Sea Street, Flounder Alley. They were running so fast it seemed more like a
dream of flying than reality.
The day had started with rain and then there had been clouds, but as they
reached Griffin's Wharf the moon, full and white, broke free of the clouds. The
three ships, the silent hundreds gathering upon the wharf, all were dipped in
the pure white light. The crowds were becoming thousands, and there was not
one there but guessed what was to be done, and all approved.
Rab was grunting out of the side of his mouth to a thick-set, active-looking
man, whom Johnny would have known anywhere, by his walk and the
confident lift of his head, was Mr. Revere. 'Me Know You.'
'Me Know You,' Johnny repeated this countersign and took his place
behind Mr. Revere. The other boys, held up by the crowd, began arriving, and
more men and boys. But Johnny guessed that many who were now quietly
joining one of those three groups were acting on the spur of the moment,
seeing what was up. They had blacked their faces, seized axes, and come
along. They were behaving as quietly and were as obedient to their leaders as
those who had been so carefully picked for this work of destruction.
There was a boatswain's whistle, and in silence one group boarded the
Dartmouth. The Eleanor and the Beaver had to be warped in to the wharf.
Johnny was close to Mr. Revere's heels. He heard him calling for the captain,
promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing
should be damaged on the ship except only the tea, but the captain and all his
crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over.
Captain Hall shrugged and did as he was told, leaving his cabin boy to
hand over the keys to the hold. The boy was grinning with pleasure. The 'tea
party' was not unexpected.
'I'll show you,' the boy volunteered, 'how to work them hoists. I'll fetch
lanterns, mister.'
The winches rattled and the heavy chests began to appear—one hundred
and fifty of them. As some men worked in the hold, others broke open the
chests and flung the tea into the harbor. But one thing made them an
unexpected difficulty. The tea inside the chests was wrapped in heavy canvas.
The axes went through the wood easily enough—the canvas made endless
trouble. Johnny had never worked so hard in his life.
He had noticed a stout boy with a blackened face working near him. The
boy looked familiar, but when he saw his white, fat hands, Johnny knew who
he was and kept a sharp eye on him. It was Dove. He was not one of the
original 'Indians,' but a volunteer. He had on an enormous pair of breeches tied
at each knee with rope. Even as Johnny upended a chest and helped get the tea
over the rail, he kept an eye on Dove. The boy was secretly scooping tea into
his breeches. This theft would come to several hundred dollars in value, but
more important it would ruin the high moral tone of the party. Johnny
whispered to Rab, who put down the axe he had been wielding with such
passion and grabbed Dove. It wasn't much of a scuffle. Soon Dove was
whining and admitting that a little of the tea had happened to 'splash' into his
breeches. Johnny got them off and kicked them and the many pounds of tea
they held into the harbor.
'He swim good,' he grunted at Rab, for everyone was talking 'Indian' that
night.
Rab picked up the fat Dove as though he were a rag baby and flung him
into the harbor. The tea was thicker than any seaweed and its fragrance was
everywhere.
Not a quarter of a mile away, quite visible in the moonlight, rode the Active
and the Kingfisher. Any moment the tea party might be interrupted by British
marines. There was no landing party. Governor Hutchinson had been wise in
not sending for their help.
The work on the Dartmouth and the Eleanor finished about the same time.
The Beaver took longer, for she had not had time to unload the rest of her
cargo, and great care was taken not to injure it. Just as Johnny was about to go
over to see if he could help on the Beaver, Mr. Revere whispered to him. 'Go
get brooms. Cleam um' deck.'
Johnny and a parcel of boys brushed the deck until it was clean as a parlor
floor. Then Mr. Revere called the captain to come up and inspect. The tea was
utterly gone, but Captain Hall agreed that beyond that there had not been the
slightest damage.
It was close upon dawn when the work on all three ships was done. And
yet the great, silent audience on the wharf, men, women, and children, had not
gone home. As the three groups came off the ships, they formed in fours along
the wharf, their axes on their shoulders. Then a hurrah went up and a fife
began to play. This was almost the first sound Johnny had heard since the tea
party started—except only the crash of axes into sea chests, the squeak of
hoists, and a few grunted orders.
Standing quietly in the crowd, he saw Sam Adams, pretending to be a most
innocent bystander. It looked to Johnny as if the dog fox had eaten a couple of
fat pullets, and had a third in his mouth.
As they started marching back to the center of town, they passed the Coffin
House at the head of Griffin's Wharf. A window opened.
'Well, boys,' said a voice, so cold one hardly knew whether he spoke in
anger or not, 'you've had a fine, pleasant evening-for your Indian caper, haven't
you? But mind ... you've got to pay the fiddler yet.'
It was the British Admiral Montague.
'Come on down here,' someone yelled, 'and we'll settle that score tonight.'
The Admiral pulled in his head and slapped down the window.
Johnny and Rab knew, and men like the Observers knew, but best of all
Sam Adams knew, that the fiddler would have to be paid. England, unable to
find the individuals who had destroyed this valuable property, would punish
the whole Town of Boston—make every man, woman, and child, Tories and
Whigs alike, suffer until this tea was paid for. Nor was she likely to back down
on her claim that she might tax the colonists any way she pleased.
Next day, all over Boston, boys and men, some of them with a little paint
still showing behind their ears, were so lame they could scarce move their
fingers, but none of them—not one—told what it was that had lamed them so.
They would stand about and wonder who 'those Mohawks' might have been, or
what the British Parliament might do next, but never say what they themselves
had been doing, for each was sworn to secrecy.
Only Paul Revere showed no signs of the hard physical strain he had been
under all the night before. Not long after dawn he had started on horseback for
New York and Philadelphia with an account of the Tea Party. He could chop
open tea chests all night, and ride all day
