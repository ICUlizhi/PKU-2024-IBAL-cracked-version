A DAY WITH THE BEAVERS
WHILE THE TWO BOYS WERE WHISPERING behind, both the girls
suddenly cried “Oh!” and stopped.
“The robin!” cried Lucy, “the robin. It’s flown away.” And so it had—
right out of sight.
“And now what are we to do?” said Edmund, giving Peter a look which
was as much as to say “What did I tell you?”
“Sh! Look!” said Susan.
“What?” said Peter.
“There’s something moving among the trees over there to the left.”
They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.
“There it goes again,” said Susan presently.
“I saw it that time too,” said Peter. “It’s still there. It’s just gone behind
that big tree.”
“What is it?” asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.
“Whatever it is,” said Peter, “it’s dodging us. It’s something that doesn’t
want to be seen.”
“Let’s go home,” said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud,
everyone suddenly realized the same fact that Edmund had whispered to
Peter at the end of the last chapter. They were lost.
“What’s it like?” said Lucy.
“It’s—it’s a kind of animal,” said Susan; and then, “Look! Look! Quick!
There it is.”
They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at
them from behind a tree. But this time it didn’t immediately draw back.
Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their
finger on their lips when they are signaling to you to be quiet. Then it
disappeared again. The children all stood holding their breath.
A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all
round as if it were afraid someone was watching, said “Hush,” made signs
to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing, and then
once more disappeared.
“I know what it is,” said Peter; “it’s a beaver. I saw the tail.”
“It wants us to go to it,” said Susan, “and it is warning us not to make a
noise.”
“I know,” said Peter. “The question is, are we to go to it or not? What
do you think, Lu?”
“I think it’s a nice beaver,” said Lucy.
“Yes, but how do we know?” said Edmund.
“Shan’t we have to risk it?” said Susan. “I mean, it’s no good just
standing here and I feel I want some dinner.”
At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the
tree and beckoned earnestly to them.
“Come on,” said Peter, “let’s give it a try. All keep close together. We
ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.”
So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in
behind it, and there, sure enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew
back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper, “Further in, come further
in. Right in here. We’re not safe in the open!” Only when it had led them
into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs
met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because
no snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk to them.
“Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?” it said.
“We’re some of them,” said Peter.
“S-s-s-sh!” said the Beaver, “not so loud please. We’re not safe even
here.”
“Why, who are you afraid of?” said Peter. “There’s no one here but
ourselves.”
“There are the trees,” said the Beaver. “They’re always listening. Most
of them are on our side, but there are trees that would betray us to her; you
know who I mean,” and it nodded its head several times.
“If it comes to talking about sides,” said Edmund, “how do we know
you’re a friend?”
“Not meaning to be rude, Mr. Beaver,” added Peter, “but you see, we’re
strangers.”
“Quite right, quite right,” said the Beaver. “Here is my token.” With
these words it held up to them a little white object. They all looked at it in
surprise, till suddenly Lucy said, “Oh, of course. It’s my handkerchief—the
one I gave to poor Mr. Tumnus.”
“That’s right,” said the Beaver. “Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest
before it actually happened and handed this over to me. He said that if
anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to—” Here
the Beaver’s voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious
nods. Then signaling to the children to stand as close around it as they
possibly could, so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it
added in a low whisper—
“They say Aslan is on the move—perhaps has already landed.”
And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew
who Aslan was any more than you do; but the moment the Beaver had
spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it has sometimes
happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don’t
understand but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning—
either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else
a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so
beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you
could get into that dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan
each one of the children felt something jump in its inside. Edmund felt a
sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous.
Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had
just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in
the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays or the
beginning of summer.
“And what about Mr. Tumnus?” said Lucy; “where is he?”
“S-s-s-sh,” said the Beaver, “not here. I must bring you where we can
have a real talk and also dinner.”
No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the beaver now,
and everyone, including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word “dinner.”
They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a
surprisingly quick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for
over an hour. Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when
suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to
fall steeply downhill. A minute later they came out under the open sky (the
sun was still shining) and found themselves looking down on a fine sight.
They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom
of which ran—at least it would have been running if it hadn’t been frozen—
a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had been built across this river,
and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course beavers
are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr. Beaver had made this
one. They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his
face—the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they’ve
made or reading a story they’ve written. So it was only common politeness
when Susan said, “What a lovely dam!” And Mr. Beaver didn’t say “Hush”
this time but “Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn’t really finished!”
Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was
now, of course, a level floor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much
lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth this was all frozen
into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along
at the very moment when the frost came. And where the water had been
trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glittering wall
of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flowers
and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and
partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an
enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that
when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of
cooking and became hungrier than you were before.
That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed
something else. A little lower down the river there was another small river
which came down another small valley to join it. And looking up that
valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he was almost sure they were
the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted
from her at the lamp-post that other day. And then between them, he
thought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less. And he thought about
Turkish Delight and about being a King (“And I wonder how Peter will like
that?” he asked himself) and horrible ideas came into his head.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Beaver, “and it looks as if Mrs. Beaver is
expecting us. I’ll lead the way. But be careful and don’t slip.”
The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for
humans) a very nice place to walk because it was covered with ice, and
though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a nasty drop
to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr. Beaver led them in
single file right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the
river and a long way down it. And when they had reached the middle they
were at the door of the house.
“Here we are, Mrs. Beaver,” said Mr. Beaver, “I’ve found them. Here
are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve”—and they all went in.
The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the
first thing she saw was a kind-looking old she-beaver sitting in the corner
with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine, and it
was from it that the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon
as the children came in.
“So you’ve come at last!” she said, holding out both her wrinkled old
paws. “At last! To think that ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes
are on boiling and the kettle’s singing and I daresay, Mr. Beaver, you’ll get
us some fish.”
“That I will,” said Mr. Beaver, and he went out of the house (Peter went
with him), and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole
in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet. They took a pail
with them. Mr. Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole (he didn’t
seem to mind it being so chilly), looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in
his paw, and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a
beautiful trout. Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of
fish.
Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs. Beaver to fill the kettle and lay
the table and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a
huge jug of beer for Mr. Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of
the house, and to put on the frying-pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy
thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like
Mr. Tumnus’s cave. There were no books or pictures, and instead of beds
there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall. And there were
hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof, and against the walls
were gum boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades
and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fishing-rods and fishingnets and sacks. And the cloth on the table, though very clean, was very
rough.
Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr. Beaver came in
with the fish which Mr. Beaver had already opened with his knife and
cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good the new-caught fish
smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for
them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before
Mr. Beaver said, “Now we’re nearly ready.” Susan drained the potatoes and
then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while
Lucy was helping Mrs. Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few
minutes everyone was drawing up their stools (it was all three-legged stools
in the Beavers’ house except for Mrs. Beaver’s own special rocking chair
beside the fire) and preparing to enjoy themselves. There was a jug of
creamy milk for the children (Mr. Beaver stuck to beer) and a great big
lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone
took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes, and all the children
thought—and I agree with them—that there’s nothing to beat good
freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has
come out of the pan half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish
Mrs. Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously
sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the kettle
onto the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was
made and ready to be poured out. And when each person had got his (or
her) cup of tea, each person shoved back his (or her) stool so as to be able
to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment.
“And now,” said Mr. Beaver, pushing away his empty beer mug and
pulling his cup of tea toward him, “if you’ll just wait till I’ve got my pipe lit
up and going nicely—why, now we can get to business. It’s snowing again,”
he added, cocking his eye at the window. “That’s all the better, because it
means we shan’t have any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to
follow you, why he won’t find any tracks.”

WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
DINNER
“AND NOW,” SAID LUCY, “DO PLEASE TELL us what’s happened to
Mr. Tumnus.”
“Ah, that’s bad,” said Mr. Beaver, shaking his head. “That’s a very, very
bad business. There’s no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that
from a bird who saw it done.”
“But where’s he been taken to?” asked Lucy.
“Well, they were heading northward when they were last seen and we
all know what that means.”
“No, we don’t,” said Susan. Mr. Beaver shook his head in a very
gloomy fashion.
“I’m afraid it means they were taking him to her House,” he said.
“But what’ll they do to him, Mr. Beaver?” gasped Lucy.
“Well,” said Mr. Beaver, “you can’t exactly say for sure. But there’s not
many taken in there that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues
they say it is—in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall. People
she’s turned”—(he paused and shuddered) “turned into stone.”
“But, Mr. Beaver,” said Lucy, “can’t we—I mean we must do something
to save him. It’s too dreadful and it’s all on my account.”
“I don’t doubt you’d save him if you could, dearie,” said Mrs. Beaver,
“but you’ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever
coming out alive.”
“Couldn’t we have some stratagem?” said Peter. “I mean couldn’t we
dress up as something, or pretend to be—oh, peddlers or anything—or
watch till she was gone out—or—oh, hang it all, there must be some way.
This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr. Beaver. We can’t just leave
him to be—to be—to have that done to him.”
“It’s no good, Son of Adam,” said Mr. Beaver, “no good your trying, of
all people. But now that Aslan is on the move—”
“Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!” said several voices at once; for once
again that strange feeling—like the first signs of spring, like good news,
had come over them.
“Who is Aslan?” asked Susan.
“Aslan?” said Mr. Beaver. “Why, don’t you know? He’s the King. He’s
the Lord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in
my time or my father’s time. But the word has reached us that he has come
back. He is in Narnia at this moment He’ll settle the White Queen all right.
It is he, not you, that will save Mr. Tumnus.”
“She won’t turn him into stone too?” said Edmund.
“Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!” answered
Mr, Beaver with a great laugh. “Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her
two feet and look him in the face it’ll be the most she can do and more than
I expect of her. No, no. He’ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in
these parts:
Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,
At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,
When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,
And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.
You’ll understand when you see him.”
“But shall we see him?” asked Susan.
“Why, Daughter of Eve, that’s what I brought you here for. I’m to lead
you where you shall meet him,” said Mr. Beaver.
“Is—is he a man?” asked Lucy.
“Aslan a man!” said Mr. Beaver sternly. “Certainly not. I tell you he is
the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea.
Don’t you know who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion—the Lion, the
great Lion.”
“Ooh!” said Susan, “I’d thought he was a man. Is he—quite safe? I shall
feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.”
“That you will, dearie, and no mistake,” said Mrs. Beaver; “if there’s
anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they’re
either braver than most or else just silly.”
“Then he isn’t safe?” said Lucy.
“Safe?” said Mr. Beaver; “don’t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you?
Who said anything about safe? ’Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good. He’s
the King, I tell you.”
“I’m longing to see him,” said Peter, “even if I do feel frightened when
it comes to the point.”
“That’s right, Son of Adam,” said Mr. Beaver, bringing his paw down
on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. “And so
you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him, tomorrow if you
can, at the Stone Table.”
“Where’s that?” said Lucy.
“I’ll show you,” said Mr. Beaver. “It’s down the river, a good step from
here. I’ll take you to it!”
“But meanwhile what about poor Mr. Tumnus?” said Lucy.
“The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,” said
Mr. Beaver, “once he’s with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we
don’t need you too. For that’s another of the old rhymes:
When Adam’s flesh and Adam’s bone
Sits at Cair Paravel in throne,
The evil time will be over and done.
So things must be drawing near their end now he’s come and you’ve come.
We’ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before—long ago, nobody
can say when. But there’s never been any of your race here before.”
“That’s what I don’t understand, Mr. Beaver,” said Peter, “I mean isn’t
the Witch herself human?”
“She’d like us to believe it,” said Mr. Beaver, “and it’s on that that she
bases her claim to be Queen. But she’s no Daughter of Eve. She comes of
your father Adam’s”—(here Mr. Beaver bowed) “your father Adam’s first
wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That’s what she
comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no,
there isn’t a drop of real human blood in the Witch.”
“That’s why she’s bad all through, Mr. Beaver,” said Mrs. Beaver.
“True enough, Mrs. Beaver,” replied he, “there may be two views about
humans (meaning no offense to the present company). But there’s no two
views about things that look like humans and aren’t.”
“I’ve known good Dwarfs,” said Mrs. Beaver.
“So’ve I, now you come to speak of it,” said her husband, “but precious
few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice,
when you meet anything that’s going to be human and isn’t yet, or used to
be human once and isn’t now, or ought to be human and isn’t, you keep
your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that’s why the Witch is
always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia. She’s been watching for
you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she’d be more
dangerous still.”
“What’s that to do with it?” asked Peter.
“Because of another prophecy,” said Mr. Beaver. “Down at Cair Paravel
—that’s the castle on the sea-coast down at the mouth of this river which
ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be—
down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it’s a saying in Narnia time
out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in
those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch’s
reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came
along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn’t be worth a shake
of my whiskers!”
All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr. Beaver was
telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during
the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:
“I say—where’s Edmund?”
There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking “Who saw
him last? How long has he been missing? Is he outside?” and then all
rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and
steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket,
and from where the little house stood in the center of the dam you could
hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into
the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction. “Edmund!
Edmund!” they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow
seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.
“How perfectly dreadful!” said Susan as they at last came back in
despair. “Oh, how I wish we’d never come.”
“What on earth are we to do, Mr. Beaver?” said Peter.
“Do?” said Mr. Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots,
“do? We must be off at once. We haven’t a moment to spare!”
“We’d better divide into four search parties,” said Peter, “and all go in
different directions. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and
—”
“Search parties, Son of Adam?” said Mr. Beaver; “what for?”
“Why, to look for Edmund, of course!”
“There’s no point in looking for him,” said Mr. Beaver.
“What do you mean?” said Susan. “He can’t be far away yet. And
we’ve got to find him. What do you mean when you say there’s no use
looking for him?”
“The reason there’s no use looking,” said Mr. Beaver, “is that we know
already where he’s gone!” Everyone stared in amazement. “Don’t you
understand?” said Mr. Beaver. “He’s gone to her, to the White Witch. He
has betrayed us all.”
“Oh, surely—oh, really!” said Susan; “he can’t have done that.”
“Can’t he?” said Mr. Beaver, looking very hard at the three children,
and everything they wanted to say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly
quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.
“But will he know the way?” said Peter.
“Has he been in this country before?” asked Mr. Beaver. “Has he ever
been here alone?”
“Yes,” said Lucy, almost in a whisper. “I’m afraid he has.”
“And did he tell you what he’d done or who he’d met?”
“Well, no, he didn’t,” said Lucy.
“Then mark my words,” said Mr. Beaver, “he has already met the White
Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn’t like to
mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes
on that brother of yours I said to myself ‘Treacherous.’ He had the look of
one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell
them if you’ve lived long in Narnia; something about their eyes.”
“All the same,” said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, “we’ll still
have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a
little beast. And he’s only a kid.”
“Go to the Witch’s House?” said Mrs. Beaver. “Don’t you see that the
only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?”
“How do you mean?” said Lucy.
“Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she’s thinking all the time
of those four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her
House her job would be done—and there’d be four new statues in her
collection before you’d had time to speak. But she’ll keep him alive as long
as he’s the only one she’s got, because she’ll want to use him as a decoy; as
bait to catch the rest of you with.”
“Oh, can no one help us?” wailed Lucy.
“Only Aslan,” said Mr. Beaver, “we must go on and meet him. That’s
our only chance now.”
“It seems to me, my dears,” said Mrs. Beaver, “that it is very important
to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on
how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he
left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won’t know that Aslan has
come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard
as far as that is concerned.”
“I don’t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan—”
began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.
“Oh yes, he was,” she said miserably; “don’t you remember, it was he
who asked whether the Witch couldn’t turn Aslan into stone too?”
“So he did, by Jove,” said Peter; “just the sort of thing he would say,
too!”
“Worse and worse,” said Mr. Beaver, “and the next thing is this. Was he
still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone
Table?”
And of course no one knew the answer to this question.
“Because, if he was,” continued Mr. Beaver, “then she’ll simply sledge
down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us
on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan.”
“But that isn’t what she’ll do first,” said Mrs. Beaver, “not if I know her.
The moment that Edmund tells her that we’re all here she’ll set out to catch
us this very night, and if he’s been gone about half an hour, she’ll be here in
about another twenty minutes.”
“You’re right, Mrs. Beaver,” said her husband, “we must all get away
from here. There’s not a moment to lose.”

IN THE WITCH’S HOUSE
AND NOW OF COURSE YOU WANT TO know what had happened to
Edmund. He had eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn’t really enjoyed
it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight—and there’s
nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the
memory of bad magic food. And he had heard the conversation, and hadn’t
enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were
taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder. They
weren’t, but he imagined it. And then he had listened until Mr. Beaver told
them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting
Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he began very quietly to edge
himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of
Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a
mysterious and lovely feeling.
Just as Mr. Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam’s flesh and
Adam’s bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door-handle; and
just before Mr. Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn’t
really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got
outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.
You mustn’t think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he
actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want
Turkish Delight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and to pay Peter out
for calling him a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he
didn’t want her to be particularly nice to them—certainly not to put them on
the same level as himself; but he managed to believe, or to pretend he
believed, that she wouldn’t do anything very bad to them, “Because,” he
said to himself, “all these people who say nasty things about her are her
enemies and probably half of it isn’t true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway,
much nicer than they are. I expect she is the rightful Queen really. Anyway,
she’ll be better than that awful Aslan!” At least, that was the excuse he
made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn’t a very good excuse,
however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch
was bad and cruel.
The first thing he realized when he got outside and found the snow
falling all round him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers’
house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now. The
next thing he realized was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been
nearly three o’clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were
short. He hadn’t reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he
turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn’t
so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.
It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker
every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him
he could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too there was no road. He
kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and
tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking
his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The
silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really think he might have
given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends
with the others, if he hadn’t happened to say to himself, “When I’m King of
Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads.” And of
course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things
he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He had just settled in his
mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about
his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what
laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing
touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather
changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became
freezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It
was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as
bright as day—only the shadows were rather confusing.
He would never have found his way if the moon hadn’t come out by the
time he got to the other river—you remember he had seen (when they first
arrived at the Beavers’) a smaller river flowing into the great one lower
down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley
down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just
left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it
at all in the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop
under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off onto his back. And
every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter—
just as if all this had been Peter’s fault.
But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley
opened out. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in
the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the
White Witch’s House. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The
House was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers
with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles. They looked like huge
dunce’s caps or sorcerer’s caps. And they shone in the moonlight and their
long shadows looked strange on the snow. Edmund began to be afraid of the
House.
But it was too late to think of turning back now. He crossed the river on
the ice and walked up to the House. There was nothing stirring; not the
slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep
newly fallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the
House, and past turret after turret to find the door. He had to go right round
to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates
stood wide open.
Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and
there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the
gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as
if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch,
afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He
stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even
if they had not been chattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don’t
know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.
Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still—for
it hadn’t moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured
a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could.
He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn’t have been
looking at him at all. (“But supposing it turns its head?” thought Edmund.)
In fact it was staring at something else—namely a little dwarf who stood
with his back to it about four feet away. “Aha!” thought Edmund. “When it
springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape.” But still the lion
never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what
the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone.
Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he had thought of that he
noticed that the lion’s back and the top of its head were covered with snow.
Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself
get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it
would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now he hardly
dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It
was cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!
The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he
suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time
there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea. “Probably,”
he thought, “this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about.
She’s caught him already and turned him into stone. So that’s the end of all
their fine ideas about him! Pooh! Who’s afraid of Aslan?”
And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did
something very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his
pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion’s upper lip and then a pair of
spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, “Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you like
being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn’t you?” But in spite
of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible,
and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight, that Edmund didn’t really
get any fun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the
courtyard.
As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues
all about—standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a
chessboard when it is halfway through the game. There were stone satyrs,
and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-a-mountains of stone. There
were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the
spirits of trees. There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse
and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon. They all looked
so strange standing there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in the
bright cold moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right
in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a
fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand. Even
though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund
did not like going past it.
He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the
far side of the courtyard. He went to it, there was a flight of stone steps
going up to an open door. Edmund went up them. Across the threshold lay a
great wolf.
“It’s all right, it’s all right,” he kept saying to himself; “it’s only a stone
wolf. It can’t hurt me,” and he raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the
huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back, opened a great,
red mouth and said in a growling voice:
“Who’s there? Who’s there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you
are.”
“If you please, sir,” said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly
speak, “my name is Edmund, and I’m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty
met in the wood the other day and I’ve come to bring her the news that my
brother and sisters are now in Narnia—quite close, in the Beavers’ house.
She—she wanted to see them.”
“I will tell Her Majesty,” said the Wolf. “Meanwhile, stand still on the
threshold, as you value your life.” Then it vanished into the house.
Edmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heart
pounding in his chest, and presently the gray wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of
the Witch’s Secret Police, came bounding back and said, “Come in! Come
in! Fortunate favorite of the Queen—or else not so fortunate.”
And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf’s paws.
He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the
courtyard had been, of statues. The one nearest the door was a little faun
with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn’t help
wondering if this might be Lucy’s friend. The only light came from a single
lamp and close beside this sat the White Witch.
“I’m come, your Majesty,” said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.
“How dare you come alone?” said the Witch in a terrible voice. “Did I
not tell you to bring the others with you?”
“Please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I’ve done the best I can. I’ve
brought them quite close. They’re in the little house on top of the dam just
up the river—with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.”
A slow cruel smile came over the Witch’s face.
“Is this all your news?” she asked.
“No, your Majesty,” said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had
heard before leaving the Beavers’ house.
“What! Aslan?” cried the Queen, “Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have
lied to me—”
“Please, I’m only repeating what they said,” stammered Edmund.
But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands.
Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.
“Make ready our sledge,” ordered the Witch, “and use the harness
without bells.”
Ten
THE SPELL BEGINS TO BREAK
NOW WE MUST GO BACK TO MR. AND Mrs. Beaver and the three
other children. As soon as Mr. Beaver said, “There’s no time to lose,”
everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs. Beaver, who
started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: “Now, Mr.
Beaver, just reach down that ham. And here’s a packet of tea, and there’s
sugar, and some matches. And if someone will get two or three loaves out
of the crock over there in the corner.”
“What are you doing, Mrs. Beaver?” exclaimed Susan.
“Packing a load for each of us, dearie,” said Mrs. Beaver very coolly.
“You didn’t think we’d set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?”
“But we haven’t time!” said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat.
“She may be here any minute.”
“That’s what I say,” chimed in Mr. Beaver.
“Get along with you all,” said his wife. “Think it over, Mr. Beaver. She
can’t be here for quarter of an hour at least.”
“But don’t we want as big a start as we can possibly get,” said Peter, “if
we’re to reach the Stone Table before her?”
“You’ve got to remember that, Mrs. Beaver,” said Susan. “As soon as
she has looked in here and finds we’re gone she’ll be off at top speed.”
“That she will,” said Mrs. Beaver. “But we can’t get there before her
whatever we do, for she’ll be on a sledge and we’ll be walking.”
“Then—have we no hope?” said Susan.
“Now don’t you get fussing, there’s a dear,” said Mrs. Beaver, “but just
get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of the drawer. ’Course we’ve got a
hope. We can’t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by
ways she won’t expect and perhaps we’ll get through.”
“That’s true enough, Mrs. Beaver,” said her husband. “But it’s time we
were out of this.”
“And don’t you start fussing either, Mr. Beaver,” said his wife. “There.
That’s better. There’s five loads and the smallest for the smallest of us:
that’s you, my dear,” she added, looking at Lucy.
“Oh, do please come on,” said Lucy.
“Well, I’m nearly ready now,” answered Mrs. Beaver at last, allowing
her husband to help her into her snow-boots. “I suppose the sewing
machine’s too heavy to bring?”
“Yes. It is,” said Mr. Beaver. “A great deal too heavy. And you don’t
think you’ll be able to use it while we’re on the run, I suppose?”
“I can’t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it,” said Mrs.
Beaver, “and breaking it or stealing it, as likely as not.”
“Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!” said the three children. And so at
last they all got outside and Mr. Beaver locked the door (“It’ll delay her a
bit,” he said) and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.
The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began
their journey. They went in single file—first Mr. Beaver, then Lucy, then
Peter, then Susan, and Mrs. Beaver last of all. Mr. Beaver led them across
the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough
sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the
valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above, them on either hand.
“Best keep down here as much as possible,” he said. “She’ll have to keep to
the top, for you couldn’t bring a sledge down here.”
It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window
from a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at
first. But as they went on walking and walking—and walking—and as the
sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how
she was going to keep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling
brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white
masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars
and could only watch the little short legs of Mr. Beaver going pad-pad-padpad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop.
Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more. And at
last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same
time when suddenly she found that Mr. Beaver had turned away from the
river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very
thickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr.
Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been
almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by
the time she realized what was happening, only his short flat tail was
showing.
Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she
heard noises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a
moment all five of them were inside.
“Wherever is this?” said Peter’s voice, sounding tired and pale in the
darkness. (I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)
“It’s an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times,” said Mr. Beaver,
“and a great secret. It’s not much of a place but we must get a few hours’
sleep.”
“If you hadn’t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting,
I’d have brought some pillows,” said Mrs. Beaver.
It wasn’t nearly such a nice cave as Mr. Tumnus’s, Lucy thought—just a
hole in the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they
all lay down they were all a bundle of clothes together, and what with that
and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If
only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs. Beaver
handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank
something—it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat, but
it also made you feel deliciously warm after you’d swallowed it—and
everyone went straight to sleep.
It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and
hours later) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and
thinking how she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers
tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth
of the cave. But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed,
and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths
and eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very sound they’d
all been thinking of (and sometimes imagining they heard) during their
walk last night. It was a sound of jingling bells.
Mr. Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it.
Perhaps you think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly
thing to do? But it was really a very sensible one. He knew he could
scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being
seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch’s sledge
went. The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering. They waited
nearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened them very
much. They heard voices. “Oh,” thought Lucy, “he’s been seen. She’s
caught him!” Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr.
Beaver’s voice calling to them from just outside the cave.
“It’s all right,” he was shouting. “Come out, Mrs. Beaver. Come out,
Sons and Daughters of Adam. It’s all right! It isn’t Her!” This was bad
grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I
mean, in Narnia—in our world they usually don’t talk at all.
So Mrs. Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all
blinking in the daylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very
frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.
“Come on!” cried Mr. Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight.
“Come and see! This is a nasty knock for the Witch! It looks as if her power
is already crumbling.”
“What do you mean, Mr. Beaver?” panted Peter as they all scrambled
up the steep bank of the valley together.
“Didn’t I tell you,” answered Mr. Beaver, “that she’d made it always
winter and never Christmas? Didn’t I tell you? Well, just come and see!”
And then they were all at the top and did see.
It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they
were far bigger than the Witch’s reindeer, and they were not white but
brown. And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment
they set eyes on him. He was a huge man in a bright red robe (bright as
hollyberries) with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that
fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest. Everyone knew him because,
though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of them
and hear them talked about even in our world—the world on this side of the
wardrobe door. But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different.
Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only
funny and jolly. But now that the children actually stood looking at him
they didn’t find it quite like that. He was so big, and so glad, and so real,
that they all became quite still. They felt very glad, but also solemn.
“I’ve come at last,” said he. “She has kept me out for a long time, but I
have got in at last. Aslan is on the move. The Witch’s magic is weakening.”
And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which
you only get if you are being solemn and still.
“And now,” said Father Christmas, “for your presents. There is a new
and better sewing machine for you, Mrs. Beaver. I will drop it in your house
as I pass.”
“If you please, sir,” said Mrs. Beaver, making a curtsey. “It’s locked
up.”
“Locks and bolts make no difference to me,” said Father Christmas.
“And as for you, Mr. Beaver, when you get home you will find your dam
finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice-gate fitted.”
Mr. Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then
found he couldn’t say anything at all.
“Peter, Adam’s Son,” said Father Christmas.
“Here, sir,” said Peter.
“These are your presents,” was the answer, “and they are tools not toys.
The time to use them is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well.” With these
words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword. The shield was the color of
silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at
the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a
sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right
size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received
these gifts, for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.
“Susan, Eve’s Daughter,” said Father Christmas. “These are for you,”
and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn.
“You must use the bow only in great need,” he said, “for I do not mean you
to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to
your lips and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will
come to you.”
Last of all he said, “Lucy, Eve’s Daughter,” and Lucy came forward. He
gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterward
that it was made of diamond) and a small dagger. “In this bottle,” he said,
“there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire-flowers that grow in
the mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends is hurt, a few drops
of this will restore them. And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need.
For you also are not to be in the battle.”
“Why, sir?” said Lucy. “I think—I don’t know—but I think I could be
brave enough.”
“That is not the point,” he said. “But battles are ugly when women fight.
And now”—here he suddenly looked less grave—“here is something for the
moment for you all!” and he brought out (I suppose from the big bag at his
back, but nobody quite saw him do it) a large tray containing five cups and
saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all
sizzling and piping hot. Then he cried out “Merry Christmas! Long live the
true King!” and cracked his whip, and he and the reindeer and the sledge
and all were out of sight before anyone realized that they had started.
Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to
Mr. Beaver, when Mrs. Beaver said:
“Now then, now then! Don’t stand talking there till the tea’s got cold.
Just like men. Come and help to carry the tray down and we’ll have
breakfast. What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife.”
So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr. Beaver
cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs. Beaver poured out
the tea and everyone enjoyed themselves. But long before they had finished
enjoying themselves Mr. Beaver said, “Time to be moving on now.”
Eleven
ASLAN IS NEARER
EDMUND MEANWHILE HAD BEEN HAVING a most disappointing
time. When the dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the
Witch would start being nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting.
But she said nothing at all. And when at last Edmund plucked up his
courage to say, “Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight?
You—you—said—” she answered, “Silence, fool!” Then she appeared to
change her mind and said, as if to herself, “And yet it will not do to have
the brat fainting on the way,” and once more clapped her hands. Another
dwarf appeared.
“Bring the human creature food and drink,” she said.
The dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with
some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned
in a repulsive manner as he set them down on the floor beside Edmund and
said:
“Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!”
“Take it away,” said Edmund sulkily. “I don’t want dry bread.” But the
Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face
that he apologized and began to nibble at the bread, though it was so stale
he could hardly get it down.
“You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,” said the
Witch.
While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and
announced that the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out,
ordering Edmund to go with her. The snow was again falling as they came
into the courtyard, but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit
beside her on the sledge. But before they drove off she called Maugrim and
he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.
“Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house
of the Beavers,” said the Witch, “and kill whatever you find there. If they
are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen.
Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West
before I find a place where I can drive across the river. You may overtake
these humans before they reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do
if you find them!”
“I hear and obey, O Queen,” growled the Wolf, and immediately he shot
away into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few
minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam and
sniffing at the Beavers’ house. But of course they found it empty. It would
have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had
remained fine, for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail
—and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the
cave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even
the footprints were covered up.
Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and
Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness
and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund, who had no coat.
Before they had been going quarter of an hour all the front of him was
covered with snow—he soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as
quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was
wet to the skin. And oh, how miserable he was! It didn’t look now as if the
Witch intended to make him a King. All the things he had said to make
himself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the
right side sounded to him silly now. He would have given anything to meet
the others at this moment—even Peter! The only way to comfort himself
now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he
might wake up at any moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did
come to seem like a dream.
This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages
about it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the
morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight. And still
they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow
and the creaking of the reindeer’s harness. And then at last the Witch said,
“What have we here? Stop!” and they did.
How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast!
But she had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot
of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and
two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dog-fox, all on stools round a table.
Edmund couldn’t quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and
there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn’t at all sure that he
didn’t see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when the sledge
stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just
risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say
something. But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was
in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The father squirrel stopped eating
with his fork halfway to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its
fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked with terror.
“What is the meaning of this?”, asked the Witch Queen. Nobody
answered.
“Speak, vermin!” she said again. “Or do you want my dwarf to find you
a tongue with his whip? What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste,
this self-indulgence? Where did you get all these things?”
“Please, your Majesty,” said the Fox, “we were given them. And if I
might make so bold as to drink your Majesty’s very good health—”
“Who gave them to you?” said the Witch.
“F-F-F-Father Christmas,” stammered the Fox.
“What?” roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few
strides nearer to the terrified animals. “He has not been here! He cannot
have been here! How dare you—but no. Say you have been lying and you
shall even now be forgiven.”
At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.
“He has—he has—he has!” it squeaked, beating its little spoon on the
table. Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared
on her white cheek. Then she raised her wand. “Oh, don’t, don’t, please
don’t,” shouted Edmund, but even while he was shouting she had waved her
wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues
of creatures (one with its stone fork fixed forever halfway to its stone
mouth) seated round a stone table on which there were stone plates and a
stone plum pudding.
“As for you,” said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the
face as she re-mounted the sledge, “let that teach you to ask favor for spies
and traitors. Drive on!” And Edmund for the first time in this story felt
sorry for someone besides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those
little stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights,
year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces
crumbled away.
Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that
the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much
wetter than it had been all last night. At the same time he noticed that he
was feeling much less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every
minute it grew foggier and warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly
as well as it had been running up till now. At first he thought this was
because the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn’t be the
real reason. The sledge jerked, and skidded and kept on jolting as if it had
struck against stones. And however the dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the
sledge went slower and slower. There also seemed to be a curious noise all
round them, but the noise of their driving and jolting and the dwarf’s
shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until
suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn’t go on at all. When that
happened there was a moment’s silence. And in that silence Edmund could
at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling,
chattering noise—and yet not so strange, for he’d heard it before—if only
he could remember where! Then all at once he did remember. It was the
noise of running water. All round them though out of sight, there were
streams, chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the
distance) roaring. And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew
why) when he realized that the frost was over. And much nearer there was a
drip-drip-drip from the branches of all the trees. And then, as he looked at
one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since
he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree. But he hadn’t time
to listen or watch any longer, for the Witch said:
“Don’t sit staring, fool! Get out and help.”
And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow—but
it was really only slush by now—and began helping the dwarf to get the
sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into. They got it out in the end, and
by being very cruel to the reindeer the dwarf managed to get it on the move
again, and they drove a little further. And now the snow was really melting
in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in every
direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund
had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those
green patches were after the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.
“It’s no good, your Majesty,” said the dwarf. “We can’t sledge in this
thaw.”
“Then we must walk,” said the Witch.
“We shall never overtake them walking,” growled the dwarf. “Not with
the start they’ve got.”
“Are you my councillor or my slave?” said the Witch. “Do as you’re
told. Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end
of the rope. And take your whip. And cut the harness of the reindeer; they’ll
find their own way home.”
The dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being
forced to walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept
on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass, and every time he slipped
the dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a flick with the whip. The Witch
walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying, “Faster! Faster!”
Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of
snow grew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off
their robes of snow. Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes
you saw the dark green of firs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks
and beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold and
presently cleared away altogether. Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down
onto the forest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree
tops.
Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly
round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground
covered in all directions with little yellow flowers—celandines. The noise
of water grew louder. Presently they actually crossed a stream. Beyond it
they found snowdrops growing.
“Mind your own business!” said the dwarf when he saw that Edmund
had turned his head to look at them; and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.
But of course this didn’t prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five
minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old
tree—gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious
than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a
bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the
chuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a
signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a
moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing
with birds’ music, and wherever Edmund’s eyes turned he saw birds
alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasing one another or having
their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.
“Faster! Faster!” said the Witch.
There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and
now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the
wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered
drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious
scents against the faces of the travelers. The trees began to come fully alive.
The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold.
Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves. As the
travelers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed
across their path.
“This is no thaw,” said the dwarf, suddenly stopping. “This is Spring.
What are we to do? Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is
Aslan’s doing.”
“If either of you mentions that name again,” said the Witch, “he shall
instantly be killed.”
Twelve
PETER’S FIRST BATTLE
WHILE THE DWARF AND THE WHITE Witch were saying this, miles
away the Beavers and the children were walking on hour after hour into
what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind
them. And by now they had even stopped saying to one another, “Look!
there’s a kingfisher,” or “I say, bluebells!” or “What was that lovely smell?”
or “Just listen to that thrush!” They walked on in silence drinking it all in,
passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out
again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far
overhead, and then into dense masses of flowering currant and among
hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering.
They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter
vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to
May. They hadn’t even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was
what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it
was her spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all
knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and
badly wrong, with the Witch’s schemes. And after the thaw had been going
on for some time they all realized that the Witch would no longer be able to
use her sledge. After that they didn’t hurry so much and they allowed
themselves more rests and longer ones. They were pretty tired by now of
course; but not what I’d call bitterly tired—only slow and feeling very
dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a
long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.
They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to
turn a little to the right (that meant a little to the south) to reach the place of
the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way they couldn’t have kept
to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the
river was soon in flood—a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood—
and their path would have been under water.
And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got
longer and the flowers began to think about closing.
“Not long now,” said Mr. Beaver, and began leading them uphill across
some very deep, springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place
where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of
the long day, made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was wondering
whether she could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly
they were at the top. And this is what they saw.
They were on a green open space from which you could look down on
the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction—except right
ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. “By
gum!” whispered Peter to Susan, “the sea!” In the very middle of this open
hilltop was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of gray stone supported
on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with
strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language.
They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing
they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful
pavilion it was—and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell
upon it—with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson
and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a
red rampant lion fluttering in the breeze which was blowing in their faces
from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of
music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had
come to see.
Aslan stood in the center of a crowd of creatures who had grouped
themselves round him in the shape of a half-moon. There were TreeWomen there and Well-Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be
called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had
made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was
like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful
giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a
pelican, and an eagle, and a great Dog. And next to Aslan stood two
leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.
But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn’t know what
to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia
sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If
the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they
tried to look at Aslan’s face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane
and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they
couldn’t look at him and went all trembly.
“Go on,” whispered Mr. Beaver.
“No,” whispered Peter, “you first.”
“No, Sons of Adam before animals,” whispered Mr. Beaver back again.
“Susan,” whispered Peter, “what about you? Ladies first.”
“No, you’re the eldest,” whispered Susan. And of course the longer they
went on doing this the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realized
that it was up to him. He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and
hastily saying to the others “Come on. Pull yourselves together,” he
advanced to the Lion and said:
“We have come—Aslan.”
“Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,” said Aslan. “Welcome, Susan and
Lucy, Daughters of Eve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.”
His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them.
They now felt glad and quiet and it didn’t seem awkward to them to stand
and say nothing.
“But where is the fourth?” asked Aslan.
“He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,” said
Mr. Beaver. And then something made Peter say,
“That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think that
helped him to go wrong.”
And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but
merely stood looking at him with his great unchanging eyes. And it seemed
to all of them that there was nothing to be said.
“Please—Aslan,” said Lucy, “can anything be done to save Edmund?”
“All shall be done,” said Aslan. “But it may be harder than you think.”
And then he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had
been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked; now it
suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well. But next minute
that expression was quite gone. The Lion shook his mane and clapped his
paws together (“Terrible paws,” thought Lucy, “if he didn’t know how to
velvet them!”) and said,
“Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of
Eve to the pavilion and minister to them.”
When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw—and though it was
velveted it was very heavy—on Peter’s shoulder and said, “Come, Son of
Adam, and I will show you a far-off sight of the castle where you are to be
King.”
And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to
the eastern edge of the hilltop. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The
sun was setting behind their backs. That meant that the whole country
below them lay in the evening light—forest and hills and valleys and,
winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. And
beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of
clouds which were just turning rose color with the reflection of the sunset.
But just where the land of Narnia met the sea—in fact, at the mouth of the
great river—there was something on a little hill, shining. It was shining
because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was reflected from all the
windows which looked toward Peter and the sunset; but to Peter it looked
like a great star resting on the seashore.
“That, O Man,” said Aslan, “is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one
of which you must sit as King. I show it to you because you are the
firstborn and you will be High King over all the rest.”
And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise
woke the silence suddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.
“It is your sister’s horn,” said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to
be almost a purr, if it is not disrespectful to think of a Lion purring.
For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the other
creatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw, “Back!
Let the Prince win his spurs,” he did understand, and set off running as hard
as he could to the pavilion. And there he saw a dreadful sight.
The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was
running toward him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face
was as white as paper. Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing
herself up, followed by a huge gray beast. At first Peter thought it was a
bear. Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big
to be a dog. Then he realized that it was a wolf—a wolf standing on its hind
legs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk, snapping and snarling. All
the hair on its back stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher
than the second big branch. One of her legs hung down so that her foot was
only an inch or two above the snapping teeth. Peter wondered why she did
not get higher or at least take a better grip; then he realized that she was just
going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.
Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick.
But that made no difference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to
the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side. That stroke never
reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and
its mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it
simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once. As it was—
though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all—he had just
time to duck down and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the
brute’s forelegs into its heart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like
something in a nightmare. He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed
neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead, and
everything was blood and heat and hair. A moment later he found that the
monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was
straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his
eyes. He felt tired all over.
Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty
shaky when they met and I won’t say there wasn’t kissing and crying on
both sides. But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that.
“Quick! Quick!” shouted the voice of Aslan. “Centaurs! Eagles! I see
another wolf in the thickets. There—behind you. He has just darted away.
After him, all of you. He will be going to his mistress. Now is your chance
to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.” And instantly with a
thunder of hoofs and beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest
creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness.
Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.
“You have forgotten to clean your sword,” said Aslan.
It was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it
all smeared with the Wolf’s hair and blood. He stooped down and wiped it
quite clean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on his coat.
“Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,” said Aslan. And when Peter
had done so he struck him with the flat of the blade and said, “Rise up, Sir
Peter Wolf’s-Bane. And, whatever happens, never forget to wipe your
sword.”

DEEP MAGIC FROM THE
DAWN OF TIME
NOW WE MUST GET BACK TO EDMUND. When he had been made to
walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the
Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew
trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all
and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let
him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was.
The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.
“No,” said the dwarf, “it is no use now, O Queen. They must have
reached the Stone Table by now.”
“Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,” said the Witch.
“It cannot be good news if he does,” said the dwarf.
“Four thrones in Cair Paravel,” said the Witch. “How if only three were
filled? That would not fulfill the prophecy.”
“What difference would that make now that He is here?” said the dwarf.
He did not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.
“He may not stay long. And then—we would fall upon the three at
Cair.”
“Yet it might be better,” said the dwarf, “to keep this one” (here he
kicked Edmund) “for bargaining with.”
“Yes! and have him rescued,” said the Witch scornfully.
“Then,” said the dwarf, “we had better do what we have to do at once.”
“I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself,” said the Witch.
“That is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.”
“It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to
its proper use,” said the dwarf.
“True,” said the Witch; and then, “Well, I will begin.”
At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.
“I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with Him. They have
killed my captain, Maugrim. I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all. One
of the Sons of Adam killed him. Fly! Fly!”
“No,” said the Witch. “There need be no flying. Go quickly. Summon
all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can. Call out the giants
and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side. Call
the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres, and the Minotaurs. Call the Cruels,
the Hags, the Specters, and the people of the Toadstools. We will fight.
What? Have I not still my wand? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as
they come on? Be off quickly, I have a little thing to finish here while you
are away.”
The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.
“Now!” said she, “we have no table—let me see. We had better put it
against the trunk of a tree.”
Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the dwarf
set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch
take off her outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly
white. Because they were so very white he could see them, but he could not
see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.
“Prepare the victim,” said the Witch. And the dwarf undid Edmund’s
collar and folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund’s hair and
pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund
heard a strange noise—whizz—whizz—whizz. For a moment he couldn’t
think what it was. Then he realized. It was the sound of a knife being
sharpened.
At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction—a
drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings—a scream from the Witch—
confusion all round him. And then he found he was being untied. Strong
arms were round him and he heard big, kind voices saying things like—
“Let him lie down—give him some wine—drink this—steady now—
you’ll be all right in a minute.”
Then he heard the voices of people who were not talking to him but to
one another. And they were saying things like “Who’s got the Witch?” “I
thought you had her.” “I didn’t see her after I knocked the knife out of her
hand—I was after the dwarf—do you mean to say she’s escaped?” “—A
chap can’t mind everything at once—what’s that? Oh, sorry, it’s only an old
stump!” But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint.
Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of
course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off
to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they
could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think
they might have been surprised.
It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright; if you had
been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump
and on a fair-sized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would
gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the
stump and the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did
look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground. And if
you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across
to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in
reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the dwarf. For
it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they
aren’t, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when
the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept hold of her wand, so it
had been kept safe, too.
When the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping
on piles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard—from Mrs.
Beaver—was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late
last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had
breakfasted they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund
walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is
no need to tell you (and no one ever heard) what Aslan was saying, but it
was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer
Aslan turned to meet them, bringing Edmund with him.
“Here is your brother,” he said, “and—there is no need to talk to him
about what is past.”
Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in
turn, “I’m sorry,” and everyone said, “That’s all right.” And then everyone
wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that
they were all friends with him again—something ordinary and natural—and
of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before
they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan
and said,
“Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.”
“Let him approach,” said Aslan.
The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch’s dwarf.
“What is your message, Son of Earth?” asked Aslan.
“The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe
conduct to come and speak with you,” said the dwarf, “on a matter which is
as much to your advantage as to hers.”
“Queen of Narnia, indeed!” said Mr. Beaver. “Of all the cheek—”
“Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan. “All names will soon be restored to their
proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about them. Tell your
mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she
leaves her wand behind her at that great oak.”
This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the dwarf to see
that the conditions were properly carried out. “But supposing she turns the
two leopards into stone?” whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea
had occurred to the leopards themselves; at any rate, as they walked off
their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling—
like a cat’s when it sees a strange dog.
“It’ll be all right,” whispered Peter in reply. “He wouldn’t send them if
it weren’t.”
A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the
hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children
who had not seen her before felt shudders running down their backs at the
sight of her face; and there were low growls among all the animals present.
Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two
people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the
Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces—the golden
face and the dead-white face—so close together. Not that the Witch looked
Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs. Beaver particularly noticed this.
“You have a traitor there, Aslan,” said the Witch. Of course everyone
present knew that she meant Edmund. But Edmund had got past thinking
about himself after all he’d been through and after the talk he’d had that
morning. He just went on looking at Aslan. It didn’t seem to matter what
the Witch said.
“Well,” said Aslan. “His offense was not against you.”
“Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?” asked the Witch.
“Let us say I have forgotten it,” answered Aslan gravely. “Tell us of this
Deep Magic.”
“Tell you?” said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller. “Tell
you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us? Tell
you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the fire-stones on
the Secret Hill? Tell you what is engraved on the scepter of the Emperorbeyond-the-Sea? You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into
Narnia at the very beginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as
my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill.”
“Oh,” said Mr. Beaver. “So that’s how you came to imagine yourself a
queen—because you were the Emperor’s hangman. I see.”
“Peace, Beaver,” said Aslan, with a very low growl.
“And so,” continued the Witch, “that human creature is mine. His life is
forfeit to me. His blood is my property.”
“Come and take it then,” said the Bull with the man’s head in a great
bellowing voice.
“Fool,” said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl, “do
you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force? He
knows the Deep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood
as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water.”
“It is very true,” said Aslan, “I do not deny it.”
“Oh, Aslan!” whispered Susan in the Lion’s ear, “can’t we—I mean,
you won’t, will you? Can’t we do something about the Deep Magic? Isn’t
there something you can work against it?”
“Work against the Emperor’s Magic?” said Aslan, turning to her with
something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion
to him again.
Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan’s
face. He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something;
but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to
wait, and do what he was told.
“Fall back, all of you,” said Aslan, “and I will talk to the Witch alone.”
They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this—waiting and wondering
while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy
said, “Oh, Edmund!” and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the
others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other’s
paws with their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their
hoofs. But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed
even small sounds like a bumble-bee flying past, or the birds in the forest
down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between
Aslan and the White Witch went on.
At last they heard Aslan’s voice, “You can all come back,” he said. “I
have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother’s
blood.” And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been
holding their breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur
of talk.
The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face
when she stopped and said,
“But how do I know this promise will be kept?”
“Haa-a-arrh!” roared Aslan, half rising from his throne; and his great
mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the
Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her
skirts and fairly ran for her life.
Fourteen
THE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCH
AS SOON AS THE WITCH HAD GONE ASLAN said, “We must move
from this place at once, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall
encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna.”
Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters
with the witch; but his face was stern and everyone’s ears were still ringing
with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared.
After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun
had got strong by now and dried the grass), they were busy for a while
taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o’clock they
were on the march and set off in a northeasterly direction, walking at an
easy pace for they had not far to go.
During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of
campaign. “As soon as she has finished her business in these parts,” he said,
“the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and
prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent
her from reaching it.” He then went on to outline two plans of battle—one
for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting
her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the
operations, saying things like, “You must put your Centaurs in such and
such a place” or “You must post scouts to see that she doesn’t do so-andso,” till at last Peter said,
“But you will be there yourself, Aslan.”
“I can give you no promise of that,” answered the Lion. And he
continued giving Peter his instructions.
For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of
him. He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.
It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river
valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the
Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water. But
Peter said,
“Wouldn’t it be better to camp on the far side—for fear she should try a
night attack or anything?”
Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, roused
himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said, “Eh? What’s that?”
Peter said it all over again.
“No,” said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn’t matter. “No. She will not
make an attack tonight.” And then he sighed deeply. But presently he
added, “All the same it was well thought of. That is how a soldier ought to
think. But it doesn’t really matter.” So they proceeded to pitch their camp.
Aslan’s mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling
uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news
that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that
evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night
or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were
already drawing to their end.
This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn’t get to sleep when
she went to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and
over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the
darkness.
“Can’t you get to sleep either?” said Susan:
“No,” said Lucy. “I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!”
“What?”
“I’ve a most horrible feeling—as if something were hanging over us.”
“Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.”
“Something about Aslan,” said Lucy. “Either some dreadful thing is
going to happen to him, or something dreadful that he’s going to do.”
“There’s been something wrong with him all afternoon,” said Susan.
“Lucy! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle? You
don’t think he could be stealing away and leaving us tonight, do you?”
“Where is he now?” said Lucy. “Is he here in the pavilion?”
“I don’t think so.”
“Susan! let’s go outside and have a look round. We might see him.”
“All right. Let’s,” said Susan; “we might just as well be doing that as
lying awake here.”
Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers
and crept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was
quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then
Susan suddenly caught Lucy’s arm and said, “Look!” On the far side of the
camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly
walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followed
him.
He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly
to the right—apparently by the very same route which they had used that
afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led
them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet
with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different from the Aslan they
knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were
very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where
there were no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It
was no good trying to run away so they came toward him. When they were
closer he said,
“Oh, children, children, why are you following me?”
“We couldn’t sleep,” said Lucy—and then felt sure that she need say no
more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.
“Please, may we come with you—wherever you’re going?” asked
Susan.
“Well—” said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, “I should
be glad of company tonight. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop
when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.”
“Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,” said the two girls.
Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the
Lion. But how slowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that
his nose nearly touched the grass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low
moan.
“Aslan! Dear Aslan!” said Lucy, “what is wrong? Can’t you tell us?”
“Are you ill, dear Aslan?” asked Susan.
“No,” said Aslan. “I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so
that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that.”
And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his
permission, but what they had longed to do ever since they first saw him—
buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so
doing, walked with him. And presently they saw that they were going with
him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood. They went up
at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got to the last
tree (it was one that had some bushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,
“Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do
not let yourselves be seen. Farewell.”
And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and
clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his
great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out on to the top of
the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him and
this is what they saw.
A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and
though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned
with evil-looking red flames and black smoke. But such people! Ogres with
monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men; spirits of evil trees and
poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won’t describe because if I
did the grown-ups would probably not let you read this book—Cruels and
Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses,
and Ettins. In fact here were all those who were on the Witch’s side and
whom the Wolf had summoned at her command. And right in the middle,
standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.
A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they
first saw the great Lion pacing toward them, and for a moment even the
Witch herself seemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and
gave a wild, fierce laugh.
“The fool!” she cried. “The fool has come. Bind him fast.”
Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan’s roar and his
spring upon his enemies. But it never came. Four Hags, grinning and
leering, yet also (at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to
do, had approached him. “Bind him, I say!” repeated the White Witch. The
Hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he
made no resistance at all. Then others—evil dwarfs and apes—rushed in to
help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on his back
and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had
done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws
could have been the death of them all. But he made no noise, even when the
enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut into
his flesh. Then they began to drag him toward the Stone Table.
“Stop!” said the Witch. “Let him first be shaved.”
Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre
with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan’s head.
Snip-snip-snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to
the ground. Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their
hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different
without its mane. The enemies also saw the difference.
“Why, he’s only a great cat after all!” cried one.
“Is that what we were afraid of?” said another.
And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him, saying things like “Puss,
Puss! Poor Pussy,” and “How many mice have you caught today, Cat?” and
“Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?”
“Oh, how can they?” said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. “The
brutes, the brutes!” for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of
Aslan looked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.
“Muzzle him!” said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his
face putting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or
three of them their hands. But he never moved. And this seemed to enrage
all that rabble. Everyone was at him now. Those who had been afraid to
come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for
a few minutes the two girls could not even see him—so thickly was he
surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him,
spitting on him, jeering at him.
At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound
and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He
was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to
hoist him onto the surface of it. Then there was more tying and tightening
of cords.
“The cowards! The cowards!” sobbed Susan. “Are they still afraid of
him, even now?”
When once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass of
cords) on the flat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four
torches, stood at the corners of the Table. The Witch bared her arms as she
had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of
Aslan. Then she began to whet her knife. It looked to the children, when the
gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone, not of
steel, and it was of a strange and evil shape.
At last she drew near. She stood by Aslan’s head. Her face was working
and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither
angry nor afraid, but a little sad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she
stooped down and said in a quivering voice,
“And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would
save the human traitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was
and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will
prevent me from killing him as well? And who will take him out of my
hand then? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you have
lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that knowledge, despair
and die.”
The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn’t
bear to look and had covered their eyes.
Fifteen
DEEPER MAGIC FROM
BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME
WHILE THE TWO GIRLS STILL CROUCHED in the bushes with their
hands over their faces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out,
“Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It
will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that
the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.”
At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great
danger. For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns
blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hilltop and
down the slope right past their hiding-place. They felt the Specters go by
them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under
the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and overhead there went a flurry of foul
wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other time they
would have trembled with fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror
of Aslan’s death so filled their minds that they hardly thought of it.
As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto the
open hilltop. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across
her, but still they could see the shape of the Lion lying dead in his bonds.
And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and
stroked his beautiful fur—what was left of it—and cried till they could cry
no more. And then they looked at each other and held each, other’s hands
for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy
said,
“I can’t bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take it
off?”
So they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold
and it was now the darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when
they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and
fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could.
And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to
describe.
“I wonder could we untie him as well?” said Susan presently. But the
enemies, out of pure spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girls
could make nothing of the knots.
I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan
and Lucy were that night; but if you have been—if you’ve been up all night
and cried till you have no more tears left in you—you will know that there
comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing was ever going
to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to these two. Hours and
hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they
were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy noticed two other things.
One was that the sky on the east side of the hill was a little less dark than it
had been an hour ago. The other was some tiny movement going on in the
grass at her feet. At first she took no interest in this. What did it matter?
Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw that whatever-it-was had begun
to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And now whatever-theywere were moving about on Aslan’s body. She peered closer. They were
little gray things.
“Ugh!” said Susan from the other side of the Table. “How beastly!
There are horrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.”
And she raised her hand to frighten them away.
“Wait!” said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still.
“Can you see what they’re doing?”
Both girls bent down and stared.
“I do believe—” said Susan. “But how queer! They’re nibbling away at
the cords!”
“That’s what I thought,” said Lucy. “I think they’re friendly mice. Poor
little things—they don’t realize he’s dead. They think it’ll do some good
untying him.”
It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the
first time the white face of the other. They could see the mice nibbling
away; dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little field mice. And at last,
one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.
The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting
fainter—all except one very big one low down on the eastern horizon. They
felt colder than they had been all night. The mice crept away again.
The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked
more like himself without them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler,
as the light grew and they could see it better.
In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so
still for hours and hours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it.
Soon there were birds singing all over the place.
It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.
“I’m so cold,” said Lucy.
“So am I,” said Susan. “Let’s walk about a bit.”
They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one
big star had almost disappeared. The country all looked dark gray, but
beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea showed pale. The sky began to
turn red. They walked to and fro more times than they could count between
the dead Aslan and the eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; and oh, how
tired their legs felt. Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out
toward the sea and Cair Paravel (which they could now just make out) the
red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very
slowly up came the edge of the sun. At that moment they heard from behind
them a loud noise—a great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had
broken a giant’s plate.
“What’s that?” said Lucy, clutching Susan’s arm.
“I—I feel afraid to turn round,” said Susan; “something awful is
happening.”
“They’re doing something worse to Him,” said Lucy. “Come on!” And
she turned, pulling Susan round with her.
The rising of the sun had made everything look so different—all colors
and shadows were changed—that for a moment they didn’t see the
important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces
by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.
“Oh, oh, oh!” cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.
“Oh, it’s too bad,” sobbed Lucy; “they might have left the body alone.”
“Who’s done it?” cried Susan. “What does it mean? Is it more magic?”
“Yes!” said a great voice behind their backs. “It is more magic.” They
looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him
before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan
himself.
“Oh, Aslan!” cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much
frightened as they were glad.
“Aren’t you dead then, dear Aslan?” said Lucy.
“Not now,” said Aslan.
“You’re not—not a—?” asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn’t
bring herself to say the word ghost. Aslan stooped his golden head and
licked her forehead. The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that
seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.
“Do I look it?” he said.
“Oh, you’re real, you’re real! Oh, Aslan!” cried Lucy, and both girls
flung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses.
“But what does it all mean?” asked Susan when they were somewhat
calmer.
“It means,” said Aslan, “that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic,
there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes
back only to the dawn of time. But if she could have looked a little further
back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would
have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a
willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor’s
stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working
backward. And now—”
“Oh yes. Now?” said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her hands.
“Oh, children,” said the Lion, “I feel my strength coming back to me.
Oh, children, catch me if you can!” He stood for a second, his eyes very
bright, his limbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail. Then he made a
leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table.
Laughing, though she didn’t know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach
him. Aslan leaped again. A mad chase began. Round and round the hilltop
he led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost
catch his tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with
his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now
stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a
happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such a romp as no one
has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with a
thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind.
And the funny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in
the sun the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.
“And now,” said Aslan presently, “to business. I feel I am going to roar.
You had better put your fingers in your ears.”
And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to
roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they
saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass
bends in a meadow before the wind. Then he said.
“We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.” And he crouched
down and the children climbed onto his warm, golden back, and Susan sat
first, holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly
to Susan. And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off,
faster than any horse could go, down hill and into the thick of the forest.
That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them
in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then
take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the bits and
imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws. Then
imagine instead of the black or gray or chestnut back of the horse the soft
roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then
imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this
is a mount that doesn’t need to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes
on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way
with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the
smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all. And you
are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right
across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny
glades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past
roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes
alight with gorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains
and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and
out into acres of blue flowers.
It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steep
hillside at a castle—a little toy castle it looked from where they stood—
which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at
such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time
even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it.
And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of
them. No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And
Aslan, not at all slacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet toward it.
“The Witch’s home!” he cried. “Now, children, hold tight.”
Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the
children felt as if they had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had
gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and
jumped—or you may call it flying rather than jumping—right over the
castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling
off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.
Sixteen
WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT THE
STATUES
“WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE!” cried Lucy. “All those stone
animals—and people too! It’s—it’s like a museum.”
“Hush,” said Susan, “Aslan’s doing something.”
He was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on
him. Then without waiting a moment he whisked round—almost as if he
had been a cat chasing its tail—and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which
(as you remember) was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it.
Then he pounced on a tall stone dryad which stood beyond the dwarf,
turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to
two centaurs. But at that moment Lucy said,
“Oh, Susan! Look! Look at the lion.”
I expect you’ve seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper
which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fire. And for a second
nothing seems to have happened; and then you notice a tiny streak of flame
creeping along the edge of the newspaper. It was like that now. For a second
after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same. Then
a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back—then it
spread—then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame licks all
over a bit of paper—then, while his hindquarters were still obviously stone,
the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds rippled into living
hair. Then he opened a great red mouth, warm and living, and gave a
prodigious yawn. And now his hind legs had come to life. He lifted one of
them and scratched himself. Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he went
bounding after him and frisking round him whimpering with delight and
jumping up to lick his face.
Of course the children’s eyes turned to follow the lion; but the sight
they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the
statues were coming to life. The courtyard looked no longer like a museum;
it looked more like a zoo. Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing
round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd. Instead of all that deadly
white the courtyard was now a blaze of colors; glossy chestnut sides of
centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy-brown
of foxes, dogs and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs;
and the birch-girls in silver, and the beech-girls in fresh, transparent green,
and the larch-girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow. And instead
of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings,
brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings,
shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.
“Oh!” said Susan in a different tone. “Look! I wonder—I mean, is it
safe?”
Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the
stone giant.
“It’s all right!” shouted Aslan joyously. “Once the feet are put right, all
the rest of him will follow.”
“That wasn’t exactly what I meant,” whispered Susan to Lucy. But it
was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened
to her. The change was already creeping up the Giant’s legs. Now he was
moving his feet. A moment later he lifted the club off his shoulder, rubbed
his eyes and said,
“Bless me! I must have been asleep. Now! Where’s that dratted little
Witch that was running about on the ground. Somewhere just by my feet it
was.” But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really
happened, and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to
repeat it all again so that at last he understood, then he bowed down till his
head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap
repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his honest ugly face. (Giants of any
sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good-tempered that
ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming. It’s a sight
well worth looking at.)
“Now for the inside of this house!” said Aslan. “Look alive, everyone.
Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady’s chamber! Leave no corner
unsearched. You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.”
And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole
of that dark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows
and with everyone’s voices crying out at once, “Don’t forget the dungeons
—Give us a hand with this door!—Here’s another little winding stair—Oh!
I say. Here’s a poor kangaroo. Call Aslan—Phew! How it smells in here—
Look out for trap-doors—Up here! There are a whole lot more on the
landing!” But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting
out,
“Aslan! Aslan! I’ve found Mr. Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.”
A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding each other by
both hands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none
the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all
she had to tell him.
But at last the ransacking of the Witch’s fortress was ended. The whole
castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the
sweet spring air flooding in to all the dark and evil places which needed
them so badly. The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the
courtyard. And it was then that someone (Tumnus, I think) first said,
“But how are we going to get out?” for Aslan had got in by a jump and
the gates were still locked.
“That’ll be all right,” said Aslan; and then, rising on his hind-legs, he
bawled up at the Giant. “Hi! You up there,” he roared. “What’s your
name?”
“Giant Rumblebuffin, if it please your honor,” said the Giant, once more
touching his cap.
“Well then, Giant Rumblebuffin,” said Aslan, “just let us out of this,
will you?”
“Certainly, your honor. It will be a pleasure,” said Giant Rumblebuffin.
“Stand well away from the gates, all you little “uns.” Then he strode to the
gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club. The gates
creaked at the first blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third.
Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of
crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each
side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble; and when the dust
cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the
gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and
the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky.
“Blowed if I ain’t all in a muck sweat,” said the Giant, puffing like the
largest railway engine. “Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither
of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket-handkerchee about you?”
“Yes, I have,” said Lucy, standing on tip-toes and holding her
handkerchief up as far as she could reach.
“Thank you, Missie,” said Giant Rumblebuffin, stooping down. Next
moment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid-air
between the Giant’s finger and thumb. But just as she was getting near his
face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground
muttering, “Bless me! I’ve picked up the little girl instead. I beg your
pardon, Missie, I thought you was the handkerchee!”
“No, no,” said Lucy laughing, “here it is!” This time he managed to get
it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would
be to you, so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across
his great red face, she said, “I’m afraid it’s not much use to you, Mr.
Rumblebuffin.”
“Not at all. Not at all,” said the giant politely. “Never met a nicer
handkerchee. So fine, so handy. So—I don’t know how to describe it.”
“What a nice giant he is!” said Lucy to Mr. Tumnus.
“Oh yes,” replied the Faun. “All the Buffins always were. One of the
most respected of all the giant families in Narnia. Not very clever, perhaps
(I never knew a giant that was), but an old family. With traditions, you
know. If he’d been the other sort she’d never have turned him into stone.”
At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.
“Our day’s work is not yet over,” he said, “and if the Witch is to be
finally defeated before bedtime we must find the battle at once.”
“And join in, I hope, sir!” added the largest of the Centaurs.
“Of course,” said Aslan. “And now! Those who can’t keep up—that is,
children, dwarfs, and small animals—must ride on the backs of those who
can—that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who
are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out
where the battle is. Look lively and sort yourselves.”
And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased
of the lot was the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending
to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met, “Did you hear
what he said? Us Lions. That means him and me. Us Lions. That’s what I
like about Aslan. No side, no stand-offishness. Us Lions. That meant him
and me.” At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with
three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog. That steadied him a
bit.
When all were ready (it was a big sheepdog who actually helped Aslan
most in getting them sorted into their proper order) they set out through the
gap in the castle wall. At first the lions and dogs went nosing about in all
directions. But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave
a bay. There was no time lost after that. Soon all the dogs and lions and
wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses
to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half a mile behind
them, were following as fast as they could. The noise was like an English
fox-hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the
hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper
and more awful roar of Aslan himself. Faster and faster they went as the
scent became easier and easier to follow. And then, just as they came to the
last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises
another noise—a different one, which gave her a queer feeling inside. It was
a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.
Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the
reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan’s army
fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had
seen last night; only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and
more evil and more deformed. There also seemed to be far more of them.
Peter’s army—which had their backs to her—looked terribly few. And there
were statues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch had been
using her wand. But she did not seem to be using it now. She was fighting
with her stone knife. It was Peter she was fighting—both of them going at it
so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening; she only saw
the stone knife and Peter’s sword flashing so quickly that they looked like
three knives and three swords. That pair were in the center. On each side the
line stretched out. Horrible things were happening wherever she looked.
“Off my back, children,” shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off.
Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the western lamp-post to the
shores of the eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White
Witch. Lucy saw her face lifted toward him for one second with an
expression of terror and amazement. Then Lion and Witch had rolled over
together but with the Witch underneath; and at the same moment all warlike creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch’s house rushed madly on
the enemy lines, dwarfs with their battleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant
with his club (and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe), unicorns with
their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs. And Peter’s tired army
cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered
till the wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.
Seventeen
THE HUNTING OF THE WHITE
STAG
THE BATTLE WAS ALL OVER A FEW MINUTES after their arrival.
Most of the enemy had been killed in the first charge of Aslan and his
companions; and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was
dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. The next thing that
Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange to
her to see Peter looking as he looked now—his face was so pale and stern
and he seemed so much older.
“It was all Edmund’s doing, Aslan,” Peter was saying. “We’d have been
beaten if it hadn’t been for him. The Witch was turning our troops into
stone right and left. But nothing would stop him. He fought his way through
three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue.
And when he reached her he had sense to bring his sword smashing down
on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made
a statue himself for his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were
making. Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance—if we
hadn’t lost so many already. He was terribly wounded. We must go and see
him.”
They found Edmund in charge of Mrs. Beaver a little way back from the
fighting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face
a nasty green color.
“Quick, Lucy,” said Aslan.
And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious
cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled
so much that she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the
end and poured a few drops into her brother’s mouth.
“There are other people wounded,” said Aslan while she was still
looking eagerly into Edmund’s pale face and wondering if the cordial would
have any result.
“Yes, I know,” said Lucy crossly. “Wait a minute.”
“Daughter of Eve,” said Aslan in a graver voice, “others also are at the
point of death. Must more people die for Edmund?”
“I’m sorry, Aslan,” said Lucy, getting up and going with him. And for
the next half-hour they were busy—she attending to the wounded while he
restored those who had been turned into stone. When at last she was free to
come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only
healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look—oh,
for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was
where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and
could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him
a knight.
“Does he know,” whispered Lucy to Susan, “what Aslan did for him?
Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?”
“Hush! No. Of course not,” said Susan.
“Oughtn’t he to be told?” said Lucy.
“Oh, surely not,” said Susan. “It would be too awful for him. Think how
you’d feel if you were he.”
“All the same I think he ought to know,” said Lucy. But at that moment
they were interrupted.
That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for
them all I don’t know; but somehow or other they found themselves all
sitting down on the grass to a fine high tea at about eight o’clock. Next day
they began marching eastward down the side of the great river. And the
next day after that, at about teatime, they actually reached the mouth. The
castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before them
were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and seaweed, and
the smell of the sea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever
and ever on the beach. And oh, the cry of the seagulls! Have you heard it?
Can you remember?
That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the
beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between
their toes. But next day was more solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of
Cair Paravel—that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west wall
hung with peacock’s feathers and the eastern door which looks towards the
sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan
solemnly crowned them and led them to the four thrones amid deafening
shouts of, “Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live
King Edmund! Long Live Queen Lucy!”
“Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well,
Sons of Adam! Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!” said Aslan.
And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of
the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in
honor of their new Kings and Queens.
So the children sat on their thrones and scepters were put into their
hands and they gave rewards and honors to all their friends, to Tumnus the
Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the
good centaurs, and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there
was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold flashed
and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter,
and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.
But amid all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And
when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn’t there they said nothing
about it. For Mr. Beaver had warned them, “He’ll be coming and going,” he
had said. “One day you’ll see him and another you won’t. He doesn’t like
being tied down—and of course he has other countries to attend to. It’s
quite all right. He’ll often drop in. Only you mustn’t press him. He’s wild,
you know. Not like a tame lion.”
And now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These
two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was
their reign. At first much of their time was spent in seeking out the
remnants of the White Witch’s army and destroying them, and indeed for a
long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of
the forest—a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one
month and a rumor of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was
stamped out. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good
trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and
young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies
and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let
live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a different sort from Giant
Rumblebuffin) on the north of Narnia when these ventured across the
frontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries
beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from
them. And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over
them. And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior,
and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grew into a tall
and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the
kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for
her hand in marriage. And she was called Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a
graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgment. He
was called King Edmund the Just. But as for Lucy, she was always gay and
golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen,
and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.
So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this
world it was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that
Tumnus (who was a middle-aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout)
came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more
appeared in his parts—the White Stag who would give you wishes if you
caught him. So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal
members of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and hounds in the
Western Woods to follow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long
before they had a sight of him. And he led them a great pace over rough and
smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses of all the courtiers were
tired out and only these four were still following. And they saw the stag
enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King
Peter (for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and
Queens for so long), “Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and
follow this beast into the thicket; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler
quarry.”
“Sir,” said the others, “even so let us do.”
So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick
wood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,
“Fair friends, here is a great marvel for I seem to see a tree of iron.”
“Madam,” said King Edmund, “if you look well upon it you shall see it
is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.”
“By the Lion’s Mane, a strange device,” said King Peter, “to set a
lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it
that if it were lit it should give light to no man!”
“Sir,” said Queen Lucy. “By likelihood when this post and this lamp
were set here there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For
this is a young wood and the iron post is old.” And they stood looking upon
it. Then said King Edmund,
“I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me
strangely. It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a
dream, or in the dream of a dream.”
“Sir,” answered they all, “it is even so with us also.”
“And more,” said Queen Lucy, “for it will not go out of my mind that if
we pass this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventures or else
some great change of our fortunes.”
“Madam,” said King Edmund, “the like foreboding stirreth in my heart
also.”
“And in mine, fair brother,” said King Peter.
“And in mine too,” said Queen Susan. “Wherefore by my counsel we
shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.”
“Madam,” said King Peter, “therein I pray thee to have me excused. For
never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our
hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice,
and the like, and then given over; but always what we have taken in hand,
the same we have achieved.”
“Sister,” said Queen Lucy, “my royal brother speaks rightly. And it
seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we
turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase.”
“And so say I,” said King Edmund. “And I have such desire to find the
signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the
richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.”
“Then in the name of Aslan,” said Queen Susan, “if ye will all have it
so, let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.”
So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had
gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was
called a lamp-post, and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that
they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And
next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty
room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but
just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same
day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the
wardrobe to hide. Mrs. Macready and the visitors were still talking in the
passage; but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the
children weren’t caught.
And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn’t been that
they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out
of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very
remarkable man, didn’t tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but
believed the whole story. “No,” he said, “I don’t think it will be any good
trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won’t get
into Narnia again by that route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if
you did! Eh? What’s that? Yes, of course you’ll get back to Narnia again
someday. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia. But don’t go
trying to use the same route twice. Indeed, don’t try to get there at all. It’ll
happen when you’re not looking for it. And don’t talk too much about it
even among yourselves. And don’t mention it to anyone else unless you
find that they’ve had adventures of the same sort themselves. What’s that?
How will you know? Oh, you’ll know all right. Odd things they say—even
their looks—will let the secret out. Keep your eyes open. Bless me, what do
they teach them at these schools?”
And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe. But if the
Professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.
