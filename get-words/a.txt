LUCY LOOKS INTO A
WARDROBE
ONCE THERE WERE FOUR CHILDREN whose names were Peter,
Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to
them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the
air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the
heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two
miles from the nearest post office. He had no wife and he lived in a very
large house with a housekeeper called Mrs. Macready and three servants.
(Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the
story much.) He himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair which
grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and they liked him almost
at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at the front
door he was so odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little
afraid of him, and Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted to laugh
and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.
As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs
on the first night, the boys came into the girls’ room and they all talked it
over.
“We’ve fallen on our feet and no mistake,” said Peter. “This is going to
be perfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.”
“I think he’s an old dear,” said Susan.
“Oh, come off it!” said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be
tired, which always made him bad-tempered. “Don’t go on talking like
that.”
“Like what?” said Susan; “and anyway, it’s time you were in bed.”
“Trying to talk like Mother,” said Edmund. “And who are you to say
when I’m to go to bed? Go to bed yourself.”
“Hadn’t we all better go to bed?” said Lucy. “There’s sure to be a row if
we’re heard talking here.”
“No, there won’t,” said Peter. “I tell you this is the sort of house where
no one’s going to mind what we do. Anyway, they won’t hear us. It’s about
ten minutes’ walk from here down to that dining room, and any amount of
stairs and passages in between.”
“What’s that noise?” said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than
she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and
rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a
little creepy.
“It’s only a bird, silly,” said Edmund.
“It’s an owl,” said Peter. “This is going to be a wonderful place for
birds. I shall go to bed now. I say, let’s go and explore tomorrow. You might
find anything in a place like this. Did you see those mountains as we came
along? And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags.
There’ll be hawks.”
“Badgers!” said Lucy.
“Foxes!” said Edmund.
“Rabbits!” said Susan.
But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick
that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the
mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.
“Of course it would be raining!” said Edmund. They had just finished
their breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set
apart for them—a long, low room with two windows looking out in one
direction and two in another.
“Do stop grumbling, Ed,” said Susan. “Ten to one it’ll clear up in an
hour or so. And in the meantime we’re pretty well off. There’s a wireless
and lots of books.”
“Not for me,” said Peter; “I’m going to explore in the house.”
Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was
the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full
of unexpected places. The first few doors they tried led only into spare
bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to
a very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armor; and
after that was a room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and
then came three steps down and five steps up, and then a kind of little
upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a balcony, and then a whole series
of rooms that led into each other and were lined with books—most of them
very old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church. And shortly after
that they looked into a room that was quite empty except for one big
wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door. There was nothing
else in the room at all except a dead bluebottle on the window-sill.
“Nothing there!” said Peter, and they all trooped out again—all except
Lucy. She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth while trying
the door of the wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would be
locked. To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls dropped
out.
Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up—mostly long
fur coats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of
fur. She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats
and rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because
she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she
went further in and found that there was a second row of coats hanging up
behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms
stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the
wardrobe. She took a step further in—then two or three steps—always
expecting to feel woodwork against the tips of her fingers. But she could
not feel it.
“This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!” thought Lucy, going still
further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her.
Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. “I
wonder is that more moth-balls?” she thought, stooping down to feel it with
her hand. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the
wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. “This is
very queer,” she said, and went on a step or two further.
Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and
hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even
prickly. “Why, it is just like branches of trees!” exclaimed Lucy. And then
she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the
back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something
cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was
standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and
snowflakes falling through the air.
Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as
well. She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark treetrunks, she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch
a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out. (She had, of
course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut
oneself into a wardrobe.) It seemed to be still daylight there. “I can always
get back if anything goes wrong,” thought Lucy. She began to walk
forward, crunch-crunch over the snow and through the wood toward the
other light. In about ten minutes she reached it and found it was a lamppost. As she stood looking at it, wondering why there was a lamp-post in
the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter
patter of feet coming toward her. And soon after that a very strange person
stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.
He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head
an umbrella, white with snow. From the waist upward he was like a man,
but his legs were shaped like a goat’s (the hair on them was glossy black)
and instead of feet he had goat’s hoofs. He also had a tail, but Lucy did not
notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the
umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen
muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too. He had a
strange, but pleasant little face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair,
and out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead.
One of his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella: in the other arm he
carried several brown-paper parcels. What with the parcels and the snow it
looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. He was a Faun.
And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all
his parcels.
“Goodness gracious me!” exclaimed the Faun.
Two
WHAT LUCY FOUND THERE
“GOOD EVENING,” SAID LUCY. BUT THE Faun was so busy picking
up its parcels that at first it did not reply. When it had finished it made her a
little bow.
“Good evening, good evening,” said the Faun. “Excuse me—I don’t
want to be inquisitive—but should I be right in thinking that you are a
Daughter of Eve?”
“My name’s Lucy,” said she, not quite understanding him.
“But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a girl?” asked the
Faun.
“Of course I’m a girl,” said Lucy.
“You are in fact Human?”
“Of course I’m human,” said Lucy, still a little puzzled.
“To be sure, to be sure,” said the Faun. “How stupid of me! But I’ve
never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted.
That is to say—” and then it stopped as if it had been going to say
something it had not intended but had remembered in time. “Delighted,
delighted,” it went on. “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is
Tumnus.”
“I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus,” said Lucy.
“And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve,” said Mr. Tumnus, “how you
have come into Narnia?”
“Narnia? What’s that?” said Lucy.
“This is the land of Narnia,” said the Faun, “where we are now; all that
lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the
eastern sea. And you—you have come from the wild woods of the west?”
“I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,” said Lucy.
“Ah!” said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, “if only I had
worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt
know all about those strange countries. It is too late now.”
“But they aren’t countries at all,” said Lucy, almost laughing. “It’s only
just back there—at least—I’m not sure. It is summer there.”
“Meanwhile,” said Mr. Tumnus, “it is winter in Narnia, and has been for
ever so long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the
snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal
summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you
came and had tea with me?”
“Thank you very much, Mr. Tumnus,” said Lucy. “But I was wondering
whether I ought to be getting back.”
“It’s only just round the corner,” said the Faun, “and there’ll be a
roaring fire—and toast—and sardines—and cake.”
“Well, it’s very kind of you,” said Lucy. “But I shan’t be able to stay
long.”
“If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,” said Mr. Tumnus “I shall
be able to hold the umbrella over both of us. That’s the way. Now—off we
go.”
And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with
this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives.
They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground
became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little
hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr. Tumnus turned suddenly
aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at
the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave.
As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a
wood fire. Then Mr. Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out
of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. “Now we shan’t be
long,” he said, and immediately put a kettle on.
Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry,
clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs
(“one for me and one for a friend,” said Mr. Tumnus) and a table and a
dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old
Faun with a gray beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought
must lead to Mr. Tumnus’s bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of
books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things. They
had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or
Men, Monks, and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a
Myth?
“Now, Daughter of Eve!” said the Faun.
And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly
boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast,
and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy
was tired of eating, the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of
life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs
who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to
dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag
who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasureseeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath
the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old
Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes
Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water
and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end.
“Not that it isn’t always winter now,” he added gloomily. Then to cheer
himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that
looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he
played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at
the same time. It must have been hours later when she shook herself and
said:
“Oh, Mr. Tumnus—I’m so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune—
but really, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes.”
“It’s no good now, you know,” said the Faun, laying down its flute and
shaking its head at her very sorrowfully.
“No good?” said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. “What
do you mean? I’ve got to go home at once. The others will be wondering
what has happened to me.” But a moment later she asked, “Mr. Tumnus!
Whatever is the matter?” for the Faun’s brown eyes had filled with tears and
then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running
off the end of its nose; and at last it covered its face with its hands and
began to howl.
“Mr. Tumnus! Mr. Tumnus!” said Lucy in great distress. “Don’t! Don’t!
What is the matter? Aren’t you well? Dear Mr. Tumnus, do tell me what is
wrong.” But the Faun continued sobbing as if its heart would break. And
even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her
handkerchief, he did not stop. He merely took the handkerchief and kept on
using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any
more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.
“Mr. Tumnus!” bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. “Do stop. Stop it
at once! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you.
What on earth are you crying about?”
“Oh—oh—oh!” sobbed Mr. Tumnus, “I’m crying because I’m such a
bad Faun.”
“I don’t think you’re a bad Faun at all,” said Lucy. “I think you are a
very good Faun. You are the nicest Faun I’ve ever met.”
“Oh—oh—you wouldn’t say that if you knew,” replied Mr. Tumnus
between his sobs. “No, I’m a bad Faun. I don’t suppose there ever was a
worse Faun since the beginning of the world.”
“But what have you done?” asked Lucy.
“My old father, now,” said Mr. Tumnus; “that’s his picture over the
mantelpiece. He would never have done a thing like this.”
“A thing like what?” said Lucy.
“Like what I’ve done,” said the Faun. “Taken service under the White
Witch. That’s what I am. I’m in the pay of the White Witch.”
“The White Witch? Who is she?”
“Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It’s she that
makes it always winter. Always winter and never Christmas; think of that!”
“How awful!” said Lucy. “But what does she pay you for?”
“That’s the worst of it,” said Mr. Tumnus with a deep groan. “I’m a
kidnapper for her, that’s what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would
you believe that I’m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the
wood, one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly
with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep
and then handing it over to the White Witch?”
“No,” said Lucy. “I’m sure you wouldn’t do anything of the sort.”
“But I have,” said the Faun.
“Well,” said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet
not be too hard on him), “well, that was pretty bad. But you’re so sorry for
it that I’m sure you will never do it again.”
“Daughter of Eve, don’t you understand?” said the Faun. “It isn’t
something I have done. I’m doing it now, this very moment.”
“What do you mean?” cried Lucy, turning very white.
“You are the child,” said Tumnus. “I had orders from the White Witch
that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to
catch them and hand them over to her. And you are the first I ever met. And
I’ve pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea, and all the time I’ve
been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell Her.”
“Oh, but you won’t, Mr. Tumnus,” said Lucy. “You won’t, will you?
Indeed, indeed you really mustn’t.”
“And if I don’t,” said he, beginning to cry again, “she’s sure to find out.
And she’ll have my tail cut off, and my horns sawn off, and my beard
plucked out, and she’ll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and
turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse’s. And if she is extra
and specially angry she’ll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a
Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled—
and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen
at all.”
“I’m very sorry, Mr. Tumnus,” said Lucy. “But please let me go home.”
“Of course I will,” said the Faun. “Of course I’ve got to. I see that now.
I hadn’t known what Humans were like before I met you. Of course I can’t
give you up to the Witch; not now that I know you. But we must be off at
once. I’ll see you back to the lamp-post. I suppose you can find your own
way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?”
“I’m sure I can,” said Lucy.
“We must go as quietly as we can,” said Mr. Tumnus. “The whole wood
is full of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side.”
They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr. Tumnus
once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out
into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun’s
cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word,
and Mr. Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they
reached the lamp-post again.
“Do you know your way from here, Daughter of Eve?” said Tumnus.
Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the
distance a patch of light that looked like daylight. “Yes,” she said, “I can see
the wardrobe door.”
“Then be off home as quick as you can,” said the Faun, “and—c-can
you ever forgive me for what I meant to do?”
“Why, of course I can,” said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand.
“And I do hope you won’t get into dreadful trouble on my account.”
“Farewell, Daughter of Eve,” said he. “Perhaps I may keep the
handkerchief?”
“Rather!” said Lucy, and then ran toward the far-off patch of daylight as
quickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough
branches brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow
under her feet she felt wooden boards, and all at once she found herself
jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the
whole adventure had started. She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her
and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she could
hear the voices of the others in the passage.
“I’m here,” she shouted. “I’m here. I’ve come back, I’m all right.”
Three
EDMUND AND THE
WARDROBE
LUCY RAN OUT OF THE EMPTY ROOM into the passage and found the
other three.
“It’s all right,” she repeated, “I’ve come back.”
“What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?” asked Susan.
“Why,” said Lucy in amazement, “haven’t you all been wondering
where I was?”
“So you’ve been hiding, have you?” said Peter. “Poor old Lu, hiding
and nobody noticed! You’ll have to hide longer than that if you want people
to start looking for you.”
“But I’ve been away for hours and hours,” said Lucy.
The others all stared at one another.
“Batty!” said Edmund, tapping his head. “Quite batty.”
“What do you mean, Lu?” asked Peter.
“What I said,” answered Lucy. “It was just after breakfast when I went
into the wardrobe, and I’ve been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and
all sorts of things have happened.”
“Don’t be silly, Lucy,” said Susan. “We’ve only just come out of that
room a moment ago, and you were there then.”
“She’s not being silly at all,” said Peter, “she’s just making up a story
for fun, aren’t you, Lu? And why shouldn’t she?”
“No, Peter, I’m not,” she said. “It’s—it’s a magic wardrobe. There’s a
wood inside it, and it’s snowing, and there’s a Faun and a Witch and it’s
called Narnia; come and see.”
The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that
they all went back with her into the room. She rushed ahead of them, flung
open the door of the wardrobe and cried, “Now! go in and see for
yourselves.”
“Why, you goose,” said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the
fur coats apart, “it’s just an ordinary wardrobe; look! there’s the back of it.”
Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw—
Lucy herself saw—a perfectly ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and
no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it. Peter went in and
rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.
“A jolly good hoax, Lu,” he said as he came out again; “you have really
taken us in, I must admit. We half-believed you.”
“But it wasn’t a hoax at all,” said Lucy, “really and truly. It was all
different a moment ago. Honestly it was. I promise.”
“Come, Lu,” said Peter, “that’s going a bit far. You’ve had your joke.
Hadn’t you better drop it now?”
Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she
hardly knew what she was trying to say, and burst into tears.
For the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it
up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought
herself to say that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun. But
Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right;
and she could not bring herself to say this. The others who thought she was
telling a lie, and a silly lie too, made her very unhappy. The two elder ones
did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and on this
occasion he was spiteful. He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking
her if she’d found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the
house. What made it worse was that these days ought to have been
delightful. The weather was fine and they were out of doors from morning
to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, and lying in the heather. But Lucy
could not properly enjoy any of it. And so things went on until the next wet
day.
That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a
break in the weather, they decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was “It”
and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where the
wardrobe was. She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew
that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched
business. But she did want to have one more look inside it; for by this time
she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not
been a dream. The house was so large and complicated and full of hidingplaces that she thought she would have time to have one look into the
wardrobe and then hide somewhere else. But as soon as she reached it she
heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing for it but to
jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her. She did not
shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a
wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.
Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund; and he came into
the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once
decided to get into it himself—not because he thought it a particularly good
place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her
imaginary country. He opened the door. There were the coats hanging up as
usual, and a smell of mothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of
Lucy. “She thinks I’m Susan come to catch her,” said Edmund to himself,
“and so she’s keeping very quiet in at the back.” He jumped in and shut the
door, forgetting what a very foolish thing this is to do. Then he began
feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He had expected to find her in a few
seconds and was very surprised when he did not. He decided to open the
door again and let in some light. But he could not find the door either. He
didn’t like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction; he even
shouted out, “Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know you’re here.”
There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a
curious sound—not the sound you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of openair sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw a
light.
“Thank goodness,” said Edmund, “the door must have swung open of
its own accord.” He forgot all about Lucy and went toward the light, which
he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of finding
himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out
from the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the
middle of a wood.
There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the
branches of the trees. Overhead there was a pale blue sky, the sort of sky
one sees on a fine winter day in the morning. Straight ahead of him he saw
between the tree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear. Everything
was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country.
There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood
stretched as far as he could see in every direction. He shivered.
He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also how
unpleasant he had been to her about her “imaginary country” which now
turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He thought that she must be
somewhere quite close and so he shouted, “Lucy! Lucy! I’m here too—
Edmund.”
There was no answer.
“She’s angry about all the things I’ve been saying lately,” thought
Edmund. And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong, he
also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet place; so he
shouted again.
“I say, Lu! I’m sorry I didn’t believe you. I see now you were right all
along. Do come out. Make it Pax.”
Still there was no answer.
“Just like a girl,” said Edmund to himself, “sulking somewhere, and
won’t accept an apology.” He looked round him again and decided he did
not much like this place, and had almost made up his mind to go home,
when he heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and
the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge
drawn by two reindeer.
The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was
so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them; their
branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fire when the
sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with
bells. On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have
been about three feet high if he had been standing. He was dressed in polar
bear’s fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel
hanging down from its point; his huge beard covered his knees and served
him instead of a rug. But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle
of the sledge sat a very different person—a great lady, taller than any
woman that Edmund had ever seen. She also was covered in white fur up to
her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a
golden crown on her head. Her face was white—not merely pale, but white
like snow or paper or icing-sugar, except for her very red mouth. It was a
beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern.
The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping toward Edmund with
the bells jingling and the dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on
each side of it.
“Stop!” said the Lady, and the dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that
they almost sat down. Then they recovered themselves and stood champing
their bits and blowing. In the frosty air the breath coming out of their
nostrils looked like smoke.
“And what, pray, are you?” said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.
“I’m—I’m—my name’s Edmund,” said Edmund rather awkwardly. He
did not like the way she looked at him.
The Lady frowned. “Is that how you address a Queen?” she asked,
looking sterner than ever.
“I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn’t know,” said Edmund.
“Not know the Queen of Narnia?” cried she. “Ha! You shall know us
better hereafter. But I repeat—what are you?”
“Please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I don’t know what you mean.
I’m at school—at least I was—it’s the holidays now.”

TURKISH DELIGHT
“BUT WHAT ARE YOU?” SAID THE QUEEN again. “Are you a great
overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard?”
“No, your Majesty,” said Edmund, “I never had a beard, I’m a boy.”
“A boy!” said she. “Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?”
Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time to
understand what the question meant.
“I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,” said the Queen.
“Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?”
“Yes, your Majesty,” said Edmund.
“And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?”
“Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.”
“A wardrobe? What do you mean?”
“I—I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,” said
Edmund.
“Ha!” said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. “A door. A
door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck
all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with.” As she spoke these
words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes
flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that
she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move.
Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.
“My poor child,” she said in quite a different voice, “how cold you
look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle
round you and we will talk.”
Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he
stepped onto the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur
mantle round him and tucked it well in.
“Perhaps something hot to drink?” said the Queen. “Should you like
that?”
“Yes please, your Majesty,” said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.
The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small
bottle which looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm,
she let one drop fall from it onto the snow beside the sledge. Edmund saw
the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it
touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jeweled cup
full of something that steamed. The dwarf immediately took this and
handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a very nice smile.
Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink. It was something
he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it
warmed him right down to his toes.
“It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,” said the Queen
presently. “What would you like best to eat?”
“Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,” said Edmund.
The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle onto the snow, and
instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which,
when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish
Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very center and Edmund had
never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very
comfortable.
While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first
Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one’s mouth full, but
soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as
much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted
to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive.
She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one
of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that
no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about
Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of
them, and kept on coming back to it. “You are sure there are just four of
you?” she asked. “Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither
more nor less?” and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept
on saying, “Yes, I told you that before,” and forgetting to call her “Your
Majesty,” but she didn’t seem to mind now.
At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking
very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he
would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was
thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted
Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more
and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till
they killed themselves. But she did not offer him any more. Instead, she
said to him,
“Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two
sisters. Will you bring them to see me?”
“I’ll try,” said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.
“Because, if you did come again—bringing them with you of course—
I’d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can’t do it now, the
magic will only work once. In my own house it would be another matter.”
“Why can’t we go to your house now?” said Edmund. When he had first
got onto the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him
to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back; but
he had forgotten about that fear now.
“It is a lovely place, my house,” said the Queen. “I am sure you would
like it. There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what’s more, I
have no children of my own. I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a
Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was
Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long;
and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I’ve ever met. I
think I would like to make you the Prince—some day, when you bring the
others to visit me.”
“Why not now?” said Edmund. His face had become very red and his
mouth and fingers were sticky. He did not look either clever or handsome,
whatever the Queen might say.
“Oh, but if I took you there now,” said she, “I shouldn’t see your brother
and your sisters. I very much want to know your charming relations. You
are to be the Prince and—later on—the King; that is understood. But you
must have courtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your
sisters Duchesses.”
“There’s nothing special about them,” said Edmund, “and, anyway, I
could always bring them some other time.”
“Ah, but once you were in my house,” said the Queen, “you might
forget all about them. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you
wouldn’t want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must go back to
your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you
understand. It is no good coming without them.”
“But I don’t even know the way back to my own country,” pleaded
Edmund.
“That’s easy,” answered the Queen. “Do you see that lamp?” She
pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp-post
under which Lucy had met the Faun. “Straight on, beyond that, is the way
to the World of Men. And now look the other way”—here she pointed in
the opposite direction—“and tell me if you can see two little hills rising
above the trees.”
“I think I can,” said Edmund.
“Well, my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you
have only to find the lamp-post and look for those two hills and walk
through the wood till you reach my house. But remember—you must bring
the others with you. I might have to be very angry with you if you came
alone.”
“I’ll do my best,” said Edmund.
“And, by the way,” said the Queen, “you needn’t tell them about me. It
would be fun to keep it a secret between us two, wouldn’t it? Make it a
surprise for them. Just bring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like
you will easily think of some excuse for doing that—and when you come to
my house you could just say ‘Let’s see who lives here’ or something like
that. I am sure that would be best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns,
she may have heard strange stories about me—nasty stories that might
make her afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and
now—”
“Please, please,” said Edmund suddenly, “please couldn’t I have just
one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home?”
“No, no,” said the Queen with a laugh, “you must wait till next time.”
While she spoke, she signaled to the dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge
swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund, calling out, “Next
time! Next time! Don’t forget. Come soon.”
Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone
calling his own name, and looking round he saw Lucy coming toward him
from another part of the wood.
“Oh, Edmund!” she cried. “So you’ve got in too! Isn’t it wonderful, and
now—”
“All right,” said Edmund, “I see you were right and it is a magic
wardrobe after all. I’ll say I’m sorry if you like. But where on earth have
you been all this time? I’ve been looking for you everywhere.”
“If I’d known you had got in I’d have waited for you,” said Lucy, who
was too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how
flushed and strange his face was. “I’ve been having lunch with dear Mr.
Tumnus, the Faun, and he’s very well and the White Witch has done
nothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can’t have found out and
perhaps everything is going to be all right after all.”
“The White Witch?” said Edmund; “who’s she?”
“She is a perfectly terrible person,” said Lucy. “She calls herself the
Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all, and all the
Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals—at least all the
good ones—simply hate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all
kinds of horrible things. And she has made a magic so that it is always
winter in Narnia—always winter, but it never gets to Christmas. And she
drives about on a sledge, drawn by reindeer, with her wand in her hand and
a crown on her head.”
Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too
many sweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with
was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted
to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.
“Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?” he asked.
“Mr. Tumnus, the Faun,” said Lucy.
“You can’t always believe what Fauns say,” said Edmund, trying to
sound as if he knew far more about them than Lucy.
“Who said so?” asked Lucy.
“Everyone knows it,” said Edmund; “ask anybody you like. But it’s
pretty poor sport standing here in the snow. Let’s go home.”
“Yes, let’s,” said Lucy. “Oh, Edmund, I am glad you’ve got in too. The
others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there.
What fun it will be!”
But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as
for her. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the
others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and
the animals; but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He
did not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they
were all talking about Narnia.
By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats
around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing
outside the wardrobe in the empty room.
“I say,” said Lucy, “you do look awful, Edmund. Don’t you feel well?”
“I’m all right,” said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very
sick.
“Come on then,” said Lucy, “let’s find the others. What a lot we shall
have to tell them! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that
we’re all in it together.”
Five
BACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE
DOOR
BECAUSE THE GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK was still going on, it took
Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others. But when at last they were
all together (which happened in the long room, where the suit of armor
was), Lucy burst out:
“Peter! Susan! It’s all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country
you can get to through the wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one
another in there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it.”
“What’s all this about, Ed?” said Peter.
And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that
moment Edmund had been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy
for being right, but he hadn’t made up his mind what to do. When Peter
suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest
and most spiteful thing he could think of. He decided to let Lucy down.
“Tell us, Ed,” said Susan.
And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than
Lucy (there was really only a year’s difference) and then a little snigger and
said, “Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing—pretending that all her story
about a country in the wardrobe is true. Just for fun, of course. There’s
nothing there really.”
Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.
Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that
he had scored a great success, and went on at once to say, “There she goes
again. What’s the matter with her? That’s the worst of young kids, they
always—”
“Look here,” said Peter, turning on him savagely, “shut up! You’ve been
perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the
wardrobe, and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her
off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite.”
“But it’s all nonsense,” said Edmund, very taken aback.
“Of course it’s all nonsense,” said Peter, “that’s just the point. Lu was
perfectly all right when we left home, but since we’ve been down here she
seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most
frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do you think you’ll do by
jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?”
“I thought—I thought,” said Edmund; but he couldn’t think of anything
to say.
“You didn’t think anything at all,” said Peter; “it’s just spite. You’ve
always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself; we’ve seen that
at school before now.”
“Do stop it,” said Susan; “it won’t make things any better having a row
between you two. Let’s go and find Lucy.”
It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later,
everyone could see that she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her
made any difference. She stuck to her story and said:
“I don’t care what you think, and I don’t care what you say. You can tell
the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I
know I’ve met a Faun in there and—I wish I’d stayed there and you are all
beasts, beasts.”
It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was
beginning to feel that his plan wasn’t working as well as he had expected.
The two older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her
mind. They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she
had gone to bed.
The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go
and tell the whole thing to the Professor. “He’ll write to Father if he thinks
there is really something wrong with Lu,” said Peter; “it’s getting beyond
us.” So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said
“Come in,” and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at
their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingers
pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the whole
story. After that he said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his
throat and said the last thing either of them expected:
“How do you know,” he asked, “that your sister’s story is not true?”
“Oh, but—” began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the
old man’s face that he was perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself
together and said, “But Edmund said they had only been pretending.”
“That is a point,” said the Professor, “which certainly deserves
consideration; very careful consideration. For instance—if you will excuse
me for asking the question—does your experience lead you to regard your
brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean, which is the more
truthful?”
“That’s just the funny thing about it, sir,” said Peter. “Up till now, I’d
have said Lucy every time.”
“And what do you think, my dear?” said the Professor, turning to Susan.
“Well,” said Susan, “in general, I’d say the same as Peter, but this
couldn’t be true—all this about the wood and the Faun.”
“That is more than I know,” said the Professor, “and a charge of lying
against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious
thing; a very serious thing indeed.”
“We were afraid it mightn’t even be lying,” said Susan; “we thought
there might be something wrong with Lucy.”
“Madness, you mean?” said the Professor quite coolly. “Oh, you can
make your minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her
to see that she is not mad.”
“But then,” said Susan, and stopped. She had never dreamed that a
grown-up would talk like the Professor and didn’t know what to think.
“Logic!” said the Professor half to himself. “Why don’t they teach logic
at these schools? There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is
telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth. You know she doesn’t
tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad. For the moment then and
unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the
truth.”
Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression
on his face that he was not making fun of them.
“But how could it be true, sir?” said Peter.
“Why do you say that?” asked the Professor.
“Well, for one thing,” said Peter, “if it was real why doesn’t everyone
find this country every time they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was
nothing there when we looked; even Lucy didn’t pretend there was.”
“What has that to do with it?” said the Professor.
“Well, sir, if things are real, they’re there all the time.”
“Are they?” said the Professor; and Peter did not know quite what to
say.
“But there was no time,” said Susan. “Lucy had had no time to have
gone anywhere, even if there was such a place. She came running after us
the very moment we were out of the room. It was less than a minute, and
she pretended to have been away for hours.”
“That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,” said
the Professor. “If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other
world (and I should warn you that this is a very strange house, and even I
know very little about it)—if, I say, she had got into another world, I should
not be at all surprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its
own; so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of
our time. On the other hand, I don’t think many girls of her age would
invent that idea for themselves. If she had been pretending, she would have
hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story.”
“But do you really mean, sir,” said Peter, “that there could be other
worlds—all over the place, just round the corner—like that?”
“Nothing is more probable,” said the Professor, taking off his spectacles
and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself, “I wonder what
they do teach them at these schools.”
“But what are we to do?” said Susan. She felt that the conversation was
beginning to get off the point.
“My dear young lady,” said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a
very sharp expression at both of them, “there is one plan which no one has
yet suggested and which is well worth trying.”
“What’s that?” said Susan.
“We might all try minding our own business,” said he. And that was the
end of that conversation.
After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that
Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined
to talk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a rather alarming subject.
And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end;
but that was not to be.
This house of the Professor’s—which even he knew so little about—
was so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and
ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house that is mentioned in
guide books and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of
stories were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am
telling you now. And when parties of sightseers arrived and asked to see the
house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs. Macready, the
housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the
armor, and the rare books in the library. Mrs. Macready was not fond of
children, and did not like to be interrupted when she was telling visitors all
the things she knew. She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the first
morning (along with a good many other instructions), “And please
remember you’re to keep out of the way whenever I’m taking a party over
the house.”
“Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round
with a crowd of strange grown-ups!” said Edmund, and the other three
thought the same. That was how the adventures began for the second time.
A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of
armor and wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed
into the room and said, “Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole
gang with her.”
“Sharp’s the word,” said Peter, and all four made off through the door at
the far end of the room. But when they had got out into the Green Room
and beyond it, into the Library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them,
and realized that Mrs. Macready must be bringing her party of sightseers up
the back stairs—instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And
after that—whether it was that they lost their heads, or that Mrs. Macready
was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life
and was chasing them into Narnia—they seemed to find themselves being
followed everywhere, until at last Susan said, “Oh bother those trippers!
Here—let’s get into the Wardrobe Room till they’ve passed. No one will
follow us in there.” But the moment they were inside they heard voices in
the passage—and then someone fumbling at the door—and then they saw
the handle turning.
“Quick!” said Peter, “there’s nowhere else,” and flung open the
wardrobe. All four of them bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the
dark. Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of course, he
remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never
shut yourself up in a wardrobe.
Six
INTO THE FOREST
“I WISH THE MACREADY WOULD HURRY up and take all these
people away,” said Susan presently, “I’m getting horribly cramped.”
“And what a filthy smell of camphor!” said Edmund.
“I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,” said Susan, “to keep
away moths.”
“There’s something sticking into my back,” said Peter.
“And isn’t it cold?” said Susan.
“Now that you mention it, it is cold,” said Peter, “and hang it all, it’s
wet too. What’s the matter with this place? I’m sitting on something wet.
It’s getting wetter every minute.” He struggled to his feet.
“Let’s get out,” said Edmund, “they’ve gone.”
“O-o-oh!” said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her what was the
matter.
“I’m sitting against a tree,” said Susan, “and look! It’s getting light—
over there.”
“By jove, you’re right,” said Peter, “and look there—and there. It’s trees
all round. And this wet stuff is snow. Why, I do believe we’ve got into
Lucy’s wood after all.”
And now there was no mistaking it, and all four children stood blinking
in the daylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in
front of them were snow-covered trees.
Peter turned at once to Lucy.
“I apologize for not believing you,” he said, “I’m sorry. Will you shake
hands?”
“Of course,” said Lucy, and did.
“And now,” said Susan, “what do we do next?”
“Do?” said Peter, “why, go and explore the wood, of course.”
“Ugh!” said Susan, stamping her feet, “it’s pretty cold. What about
putting on some of these coats?”
“They’re not ours,” said Peter doubtfully.
“I am sure nobody would mind,” said Susan; “it isn’t as if we wanted to
take them out of the house; we shan’t take them even out of the wardrobe.”
“I never thought of that, Su,” said Peter. “Of course, now you put it that
way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it
in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in
the wardrobe.”
They immediately carried out Susan’s very sensible plan. The coats
were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and
looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But
they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in
their new getups and more suitable to the landscape.
“We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,” said Lucy.
“This is going to be exciting enough without pretending,” said Peter, as
he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish
clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.
“I say,” began Edmund presently, “oughtn’t we to be bearing a bit more
to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?” He had forgotten for
the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before.
The moment the words were out of his mouth he realized that he had given
himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.
“So you really were here,” he said, “that time Lu said she’d met you in
here—and you made out she was telling lies.”
There was a dead silence. “Well, of all the poisonous little beasts—”
said Peter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed,
indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed their journey; but
Edmund was saying to himself, “I’ll pay you all out for this, you pack of
stuck-up, self-satisfied prigs.”
“Where are we going anyway?” said Susan, chiefly for the sake of
changing the subject.
“I think Lu ought to be the leader,” said Peter; “goodness knows she
deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?”
“What about going to see Mr. Tumnus?” said Lucy. “He’s the nice Faun
I told you about.”
Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping
their feet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she
would be able to find the way, but she recognized an odd-looking tree on
one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground
became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr.
Tumnus’s cave. But there a terrible surprise awaited them.
The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside,
the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that
had not been lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the
doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which
turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had
apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out. The crockery
lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun’s father had been
slashed into shreds with a knife.
“This is a pretty good washout,” said Edmund; “not much good coming
here.”
“What is this?” said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece
of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the floor.
“Is there anything written on it?” asked Susan.
“Yes, I think there is,” answered Peter, “but I can’t read it in this light.
Let’s get out into the open air.”
They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read
out the following words:
The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under
arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against
her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair
Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her
said Majesty’s enemies, harboring spies and fraternizing with
Humans.
signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police,
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!
The children stared at each other.
“I don’t know that I’m going to like this place after all,” said Susan.
“Who is this Queen, Lu?” said Peter. “Do you know anything about
her?”
“She isn’t a real queen at all,” answered Lucy; “she’s a horrible witch,
the White Witch. Everyone—all the wood people—hate her. She has made
an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and
never Christmas.”
“I—I wonder if there’s any point in going on,” said Susan. “I mean, it
doesn’t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won’t be much fun
either. And it’s getting colder every minute, and we’ve brought nothing to
eat. What about just going home?”
“Oh, but we can’t, we can’t,” said Lucy suddenly; “don’t you see? We
can’t just go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun
has got into this trouble. He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way
back. That’s what it means by comforting the Queen’s enemies and
fraternizing with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him.”
“A lot we could do!” said Edmund, “when we haven’t even got anything
to eat!”
“Shut up—you!” said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund.
“What do you think, Susan?”
“I’ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right,” said Susan. “I don’t want to go a
step further and I wish we’d never come. But I think we must try to do
something for Mr. Whatever-his-name-is—I mean the Faun.”
“That’s what I feel too,” said Peter. “I’m worried about having no food
with us. I’d vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only
there doesn’t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again
when once you’ve got out of it. I think we’ll have to go on.”
“So do I,” said both the girls.
“If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!” said Peter.
They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, “Look!
There’s a robin, with such a red breast. It’s the first bird I’ve seen here. I
say!—I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to
say something to us.” Then she turned to the Robin and said, “Please, can
you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?” As she said this she
took a step toward the bird. It at once flew away but only as far as to the
next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood
all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the
four children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away
again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard. (You
couldn’t have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.)
“Do you know,” said Lucy, “I really believe he means us to follow
him.”
“I’ve an idea he does,” said Susan. “What do you think, Peter?”
“Well, we might as well try it,” answered Peter.
The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going
from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them, but always so near that
they could easily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly downhill.
Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the
branch. Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out
and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright. They had been
traveling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front,
when Edmund said to Peter, “if you’re not still too high and mighty to talk
to me, I’ve something to say which you’d better listen to.”
“What is it?” asked Peter.
“Hush! Not so loud,” said Edmund; “there’s no good frightening the
girls. But have you realized what we’re doing?”
“What?” said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.
“We’re following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know
which side that bird is on? Why shouldn’t it be leading us into a trap?”
“That’s a nasty idea. Still—a robin, you know. They’re good birds in all
the stories I’ve ever read. I’m sure a robin wouldn’t be on the wrong side.”
“If it comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the
Fauns are in the right and the Queen (yes, I know we’ve been told she’s a
witch) is in the wrong? We don’t really know anything about either.”
“The Faun saved Lucy.”
“He said he did. But how do we know? And there’s another thing too.
Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here?”
“Great Scott!” said Peter, “I hadn’t thought of that.”
“And no chance of dinner either,” said Edmund.
