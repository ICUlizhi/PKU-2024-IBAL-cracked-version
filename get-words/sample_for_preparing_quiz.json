Silently they floated in on the town, but when their icy eyes sighted the first dead fish, first bits of garbage about the ships and wharves, they began to scream and quarrel. The cocks in Boston back yards had long before cried the coming of day. Now the hens were also awake, scratching, clucking, Cats in malt houses, granaries, ship holds, mansions, and hovels caught a last mouse, settled down to wash their fur and sleep. Cats did not work by day. In stables horses shook their halters and whinnied. In barns cows lowed to be milked. Boston slowly opened its eyes, stretched, and woke. The sun struck in horizontally from the east, flashing upon weathervanes—brass cocks and arrows, here a glass-eyed Indian, there a copper grasshopper—and the bells in the steeples cling-clanged, telling the people it was time to be up and about. In hundreds of houses sleepy women woke sleepier children. Get up and to work. Ephraim, get to the pump, fetch Mother water. Ann, get to the barn, milk the cow and drive her to the Common. Start the fire, Silas. Put on a clean shirt, James. Dolly, if you aren't up before I count ten... And so, in a crooked little house at the head of Hancock's Wharf on crowded Fish Street, Mrs. Lapham stood at the foot of a ladder leading to the attic where her father-in-law's apprentices slept. These boys were luckier than most apprentices. Their master was too feeble to climb ladders; the middle-aged mistress too stout. It was only her bellows that could penetrate to their quarters—not her heavy hands. 'Boys?' No answer. 'Dove?' 'Coming, ma'am.' Dove turned over for one more snooze. Frustrated, she shook the ladder she was too heavy to climb. She wished she could shake 'them limbs of Satan.' 'Dusty Miller—let me hear your voice.' 'Here it is,' piped Dusty pertly. Her voice changed to pleading. 'Johnny—you get them two lazy lug-a-beds up. Get them down here. You pull that worthless Dove right out'er bed. You give Dusty a kick for me. I'm waiting for him to fetch fresh water so's I can get on with breakfast.' Johnny Tremain was on his foot. He did not bother to answer his mistress. He turned to the fat, pale, almost white-haired boy still wallowing in bed. 'Hear that, Dove?' 'Oh—you ... leave me lay, can't you?' Grumbling, he swung his legs out of the bed the three boys shared. Johnny was already in his leather breeches, pulling on his coarse shirt, tucking in the tails. He was a rather skinny boy, neither large nor small for fourteen. He had a thin, sleep-flushed face, light eyes, a wry mouth, and fair, lank hair. Although two years younger than the swinish Dove, inches shorter, pounds lighter, he knew, and old Mr. Lapham knew, busy Mrs. Lapham and her four daughters and Dove and Dusty also knew, that Johnny Tremain was boss of the attic, and almost of the house. Dusty Miller was eleven. It was easy for Johnny to say, 'Look sharp, Dusty,' and little Dusty looked sharp. But Dove (his first name had long ago been forgotten) hated the way the younger apprentice lorded it over him, telling him when to go to bed, when to get up, criticizing his work in the silversmith's shop as though he were already a master smith. Hadn't he been working four years for Mr. Lapham and Johnny only two? Why did the boy have to be so infernally smart with his hands—and his tongue? 'Look here, Johnny, I'm not getting up 'cause you tell me to. I'm getting up 'cause Mrs. Lapham tells me to.' 'All right,' said Johnny blandly, 'just so you're up.' There was only one window in the attic. Johnny always stood before it as he dressed. He liked this view down the length of Hancock's Wharf. Counting houses, shops, stores, sail lofts, and one great ship after another, home again after their voyaging, content as cows waiting to be milked. He watched the gulls, so fierce and beautiful, fighting and screaming among the ships. Beyond the wharf was the sea and the rocky islands where gulls nested. He knew to the fraction of a moment how long it would take the two other boys to get into their clothes. Swinging about, he leaped for the head of the ladder, hardly looking where he went. One of Dove's big feet got there first. Johnny stumbled, caught himself, and swung silently about at Dove. 'Gosh, Johnny. I'm sorry,' snickered Dove. 'Sorry, eh?...you're going to be a lot sorrier...' 'I just didn't notice...' 'You do that again and I'll beat you up again. You overgrown pig-of-alouse. You...' He went on from there. Mr. Lapham was strict about his boys swearing, but Johnny could get along very well without. Whatever a 'pig-of-alouse' was, it did describe the whitish, flaccid, parasitic Dove. Little Dusty froze as the older boys quarreled. He knew Johnny could beat up Dove any time he chose. He worshiped Johnny and did not like Dove, but he and Dove were bound together by their common servitude to Johnny's autocratic rule. Half of Dusty sympathized with one boy, half of him with the other, in this quarrel. It seemed to him that everybody liked Johnny. Old Mr. Lapham because he was so clever at his work. Mrs. Lapham because he was reliable. The four Lapham girls because he sassed them so—and then grinned. Most of the boys in the other shops around Hancock's Wharf liked Johnny, although some of them fought him on sight. Only Dove hated him. Sometimes he would get Dusty in a corner, tell him in a hoarse whisper how he was going to get a pair of scissors and cut out Johnny Tremain's heart. But he never dared do more than trip him—and then whine out of it. 'Someday,' said Johnny, his good nature restored, 'I'll kill you, Dove. In the meantime, you have your uses. You get out the buckets and run to North Square and fetch back drinking water.' The Laphams were on the edge of the sea. Their well was brackish. 'Look here—Mrs. Lapham said Dusty was to go and...' 'Get along with you. Don't you go arguing with me.'```\n\n  用中文给这一段做一个故事梗概,多补充一点细节分点列出,并在你认为重点的地方给出英文对照",

    "user": " \nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and\nconduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old\nbell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a gothic window in\nthe wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds,\nwith tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its\nfrozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\ncorner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had\nlighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys\nwere gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze\nin rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly\ncongealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops\nwhere holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp-heat of the windows,\nmade pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades\nbecame a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to\nimpossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had\nanything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion\nHouse, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a\nLord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had\nfined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up tomorrow’s pudding in his garret, while his\nlean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint\nDunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather\nas that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have\nroared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and\nmumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at\nScrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first\nsound of —\n‘God bless you merry gentleman!\nMay nothing you dismay!’\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in\nterror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an illwill Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the\nexpectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on\nhis hat.\n‘You’ll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?’ said Scrooge.\n‘If quite convenient, sir.’\n‘It’s not convenient,’said Scrooge, ‘and it’s not fair. If I was to stop halfa-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill used, I’ll be bound?’\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n‘And yet,’ said Scrooge, ‘you don’t think me ill used, when I pay a day’s\nwages for no work.’\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n‘A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!’ said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. ‘But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning!’\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of\nhis white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat),\nwent down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\nhonour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as\nhard as he could pelt, to play at blind-man’s buff.\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with\nhis banker’s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once\nbelonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\nlowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that\none could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a\nyoung house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and have\nforgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for\nnobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\nThe yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain\nto grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old\ngateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in\nmournful meditation on the threshold.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker\non the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\nseen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place; also that\nScrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the\nCity of London, even including — which is a bold word — the corporation,\naldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not\nbestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven-years’\ndead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can,\n\n",
