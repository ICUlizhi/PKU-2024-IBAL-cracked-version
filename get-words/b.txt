 \nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and\nconduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old\nbell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a gothic window in\nthe wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds,\nwith tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its\nfrozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the\ncorner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had\nlighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys\nwere gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze\nin rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly\ncongealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops\nwhere holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp-heat of the windows,\nmade pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades\nbecame a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to\nimpossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had\nanything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion\nHouse, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a\nLord Mayor’s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had\nfined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up tomorrow’s pudding in his garret, while his\nlean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint\nDunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch of such weather\nas that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have\nroared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and\nmumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at\nScrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first\nsound of —\n‘God bless you merry gentleman!\nMay nothing you dismay!’\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in\nterror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an illwill Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the\nexpectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on\nhis hat.\n‘You’ll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?’ said Scrooge.\n‘If quite convenient, sir.’\n‘It’s not convenient,’said Scrooge, ‘and it’s not fair. If I was to stop halfa-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill used, I’ll be bound?’\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n‘And yet,’ said Scrooge, ‘you don’t think me ill used, when I pay a day’s\nwages for no work.’\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n‘A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!’ said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. ‘But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning!’\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of\nhis white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat),\nwent down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in\nhonour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as\nhard as he could pelt, to play at blind-man’s buff.\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with\nhis banker’s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once\nbelonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a\nlowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that\none could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a\nyoung house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and have\nforgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for\nnobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\nThe yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain\nto grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old\ngateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in\nmournful meditation on the threshold.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker\non the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had\nseen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place; also that\nScrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the\nCity of London, even including — which is a bold word — the corporation,\naldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not\nbestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven-years’\ndead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can,\n\n
